Officially created in collaboration with UK motoring magazine Autocar, the 340R was first shown as a concept at the October 1998 Birmingham Motor Show. However, 340R production did not start until around 12 months later, and the 340 customers, roughly a third in LHD, did not start taking delivery until the spring of 2000. Although the 340R was a terrific track car, benefiting particularly from a new generation of A038 Yokohama tires on unique 12-spoke 6x15 and 8x16-inch wheels, it was the brainchild of Russell Carr at Lotus Design, rather than the engineering division. Ultimately, it was achieving that basic starkness for the customers in a slightly more practical and aerodynamically stable form that took the most time.\n\nAt the August 1999 London launch of the £35,000 production version, Lotus Chief Designer Russell Carr commented, \"The clients stayed loyal to the concept. We were worried they would see it as some sort of Lotus Seven carry-over, but the 340R was much more sophisticated than that.\"",

I did the original concept for the 340R, but Steve Crijns did the revised production version and we had four modellers working on the project from 1998 onward.\"\nFollowing that Autumn 1998 show car, the board at Lotus gave approval for the project to go ahead. Now the six-strong hardcore engineering and design team started to grapple with the realities of European Type Approval and the aerodynamic results turned in by Richard Hill working at MIRA.

Chief changes prompted by the wind tunnel were a rear wing mounted on pylons and raked rather than the 1998 raised lip layout. Once again, rear end downforce was sought, but the front biplane wing set also became more effective: featuring an elongated bib front spoiler framed with vertical strakes that connected to an upper wing surface, both elements improved the original design’s front-end aerodynamic characteristics significantly. Cooling was also a major concern solved in the wind tunnel. Deeper front radiator ducts complemented an enlarged front grille, which was adorned with a brace of driving lamps. The main side panels were reprofiled to direct more air into the engine bay, resulting in an even more extreme and durable version of the 340R than had been envisaged.\n\nOther engineering changes over the 1998 projections for the 340R comprised extended mudguards, which were also aerodynamically beneficial, and a serious assault on noise levels to meet type approval legislation.

Standard performance was strongest on acceleration, but to really get the best from the 340R on track, the production gearbox could easily be replaced with a Quaife track box, equipped with ratios better suited to keeping the higher-powered engine in the 4000-8000rpm power bands.

Compared to the Elise Sport racers, the biggest change that Russell Carr's design team had to face was improving road-going aerodynamic downforce over that of any other Elise. They also replaced racetrack impracticalities, adding bigger clearances for the new front splitter and abandoning the central driving position of the single-seat race-bred competitors. Most visibly, the front apron/splitter was raised to allow access over the humps that clutter modern streets and car park access areas.

Steve Crijns commented, \"We wanted to create a shape that would reflect an incredible driving experience. The car has to look a hell of a lot more exciting than your everyday two-seater Cabrio. But we also wanted to be honest and not have any features just for stylistic effect.\" \"We started by shrink-wrapping the bodywork around the mechanical components,\" Crijns continued, \"Very early in the design phase, the full-size clay model went to the wind-tunnel where the rear spoiler and rear diffuser were created to optimize downforce without causing drag.\" A new rear diffuser in composite material augmented the regular Elise alloy panel flat under-floor sections and, in conjunction with the Elise S2's increased length, was more effective. Some motoring experts may have felt that the Elise went soft in its second edition, but they were no doubt deceived by the enhanced practicality: bigger boot, larger doorway access, and an options list that took in carpets, radio, and, by 2002, even air-conditioning.

Lotus engineers managed the apparently impossible feat of stiffening up the chassis while simultaneously making the responses on the ragged edge a lot safer for an increased percentage of customers. Critical paths to such unlikely progress were the bespoke Bridgestone tyres and the installation of Bilstein high pressure damping instead of the Konis previously used. Forged steel hub-carriers replaced the original extruded aluminium ones and were accompanied by new wishbones, bushes, and mounting points for the aforementioned dampers. Both front and rear track was increased, as were the camber settings at the rear, while the chassis ride-height was lowered. The other tangible customer benefit of the S2 Elise was a far higher level of exterior finish brought about by the use of a new process for manufacturing the all-new composite body panels.

This was possibly due to the small rise in curb weight.

Autocar summarized the Series 2 Elise succinctly when they wrote: \"Does the impossible – betters the original Elise.

Despite its exhilarating performance, the 135R managed to remain a very usable road car for everyday use, offering the driver the best of both worlds. The power output of 135bhp was achieved by modifying the ports of the cylinder head to improve gas flow, fuel mixture, and maximize cylinder capacity. The standard Elise intake manifold was replaced by a cast alloy version as used on the 111S. Alongside a reprogrammed ECU, these modifications further improved the Elise's 'engine breathing,' allowing the driver to fully explore maximum engine revs in all gears, and increasing driver enjoyment, especially during events such as the fast-growing track-day scene.

The first Lotus soapbox, designated as the Type 119, was entered in the open-topped 'roadster' class, rather than the more challenging closed-cockpit 'streamliner' class. Led by David Stacey, the team was granted access to the extensive facilities at Lotus’ Hethel site, but it could only work outside working hours and within the regulations’ budget. Support would eventually be required from over 150 Lotus employees, from metalwork fabricators to CAD modellers, from Lotus Design stylists to buyers. The team also brought in sponsors to supply hi-tech materials in return for logo placement on the vehicle.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, the Group Lotus board gave approval for a team of young engineers on the company’s Graduate Scheme to enter the prestigious 'Goodwood Gravity Racing Club Soapbox Challenge', paving the way for what was to become an annual graduate project. To ensure a super smooth aerodynamic profile, the advanced carbon composite monocoque chassis was designed using the latest Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software, while ultra-lightweight components were used to minimize the overall weight. The soapbox's performance was impressive, with a top speed of 60 mph and an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds.

The Type 119's neatest trick, though, was its clever Active Mass Distribution (AMD) system that shifted lead ballast laterally to the side of the soapbox on the inside of the corner. This optimized the weight distribution to produce more grip, resulting in faster cornering. It was ingenious, and pilot Paul Adams claimed that at high speed he could gently steer the soapbox using only the AMD. After the nine-month program, glory eluded the Type 119 at Goodwood 2002. Over the two runs, Adams piloted the Type 119 to second in class and third overall behind BMW's Project Rolls Royce roadster and McLaren's streamliner. It was, however, a gallant debut in a field of 26 competitors. The following year, five newly employed graduates took up the Goodwood challenge with the Type 119B roadster.

James Setter led the team and believed victory would result from achieving the minimum possible aerodynamic and rolling resistance, so a brand new monocoque chassis design was penned. Many of the sponsors were retained for 2003's assault, and the majority of the materials and component solutions were identical. The team now had access to a wind tunnel and used it to refine the 119B's profile, while lightweight titanium steering components borrowed from Formula 1 helped improve the steering. Larger 26-inch Mavic wheels were expected to maximize the top speed, and enclosing them would further reduce drag. Top spec wheel hubs and bearings kept rolling resistance to an absolute minimum, while high-quality tires offered optimal levels of grip for the high-speed bends of the Goodwood hill.

However, the first Exige has quickly become a collectable classic, and 3-4 year old examples were still very much in demand at main dealers when the second edition arrived in Britain. The dramatic styling and ultimate cornering speed owed much to the creativity of Lotus Design’s Steve Crijns under the direction of Russell Carr, along with some serious wind tunnel work. Crijns also deserves credit for a functional reappraisal of his S2 Elise handiwork: smoother and wider front air intakes, emphasized wheel arches, and a vented engine compartment made possible by a new rear clamshell that also deleted fake vents around the tail lights. One side effect was to deliver a formal boot area for the Exige, now much more accessible than previously, as the lowered rear wing was integrated with the engine cover hatch.\n\nObvious aerodynamic work appeared in a tail plane that crouched on the back deck and fixed at an 11.5-degree rake, to optimally balance drag and downforce. The extended front spoiler splitter with ground clearance set at 108mm and the black anodized rear diffuser underline the serious treatment given to underbody aerodynamics, with the Elise particularly suited to flat floor techniques.",

It was active above 5 mph and was designed to react much more quickly than many other brake-based systems. The 2-Eleven used a unique, stronger, and stiffer high-sided variant of the Elise lightweight chassis, now known as the Lotus Small Platform Chassis, featuring epoxy-bonded aluminum alloy extrusions with modified Exige S-based running gear. Additional chassis safety features included an FIA-compliant 6-point rollover structure with integral harness mounts and a lightweight galvanized steel rear subframe incorporating a further crushable structure. The all-new ultra-lightweight composite bodywork panels weighed 40 kg/88 lb and were bolted on for ease of removal, maintenance, and repair.\n\nThe 5-spoke lightweight forged black alloy wheels were sized front 7Jx16, rear 8Jx17 and were shod with Lotus Sport-specific Yokohama A048 R LTS tires, designed to maximize grip and achieve the exacting ride and handling targets set by Lotus. The front tires were 195/50R16, and the rear tires were 225/45. The brake system deployed 288mm cast iron cross-drilled and ventilated discs, upgraded Pagid RS14 sports brake pads fitted to aluminum alloy AP Racing 2-piston at the front and Brembo single sliding piston at the rear.

With increased levels of both practicality and refinement in comparison to the simplicity of the Elise and Exige models, Lotus created a \"More Luxury\" driving experience. Based on the Lotus Small Platform chassis, the Europa S was not a derivative of the Elise or the Exige and, following a two-year plus development program, was allocated a new Lotus Type number of 121. Seen by project manager Tony Shute as a slightly larger and more comfortable almost-GT-style car but still extreme, the Europa was built to include creature comforts such as satellite navigation and leather trim. The Europa S still followed the core Lotus philosophy of performance through lightweight, which enabled this refined and high-performing GT car to weigh in at just 995 kg. This low weight was obtained through the clever use of advanced and high-tech materials, including the now familiar extruded and bonded aluminum chassis, composite body panels, and a very advanced composite energy-absorbing front crash structure. As all Elise drivers know, extricating yourself from an Elise/Exige with the roof on can be a challenge.",

As you might expect of a car with 218bhp and weighing only 1987lb, the performance of the Elise SC was electrifying, with 0-60mph reached in 4.4 seconds; 0-100mph in 10.7 seconds and a top speed of 150mph. For the record, the Exige S remained the faster car on track, thanks to its superior aerodynamics package that generated 42kg (92lb) of downforce at 100mph. The fuel economy of the Elise SC was impressive, with an estimated combined figure of 31.0mpg. In the emerging safety-conscious age and with more and more owners using their Elise or Exige as daily transport, demand had been growing for standard-fit airbags, and for 2008 Lotus responded by providing driver and passenger airbags as standard on all Elise and Exige models. Previously they were only available as part of the Super Touring option package. The new instrument pack in the Elise SC contained a pair of new stylishly back-lit dials and also featured a high-definition LCD message panel that could display a scrolling text message with vehicle systems information.

Combined with the absence of an intercooler and its associated pipework, this integrated supercharger/intake assembly contributed to an 8kg reduction in engine weight compared with the Exige S. A further benefit of dispensing with the intercooler for the Elise SC application was the supercharger packaging viability for Elise and improved rear visibility when adopted into the Exige S, where vision from the rear view mirror was masked by the intercooler installation.

Bespoke performance enhancements were developed to offer a car with even greater levels of handling and acceleration capable of taming Europe’s most challenging race circuits. In traditional Lotus style, weight saving was paramount. Weighing in at just 928kg, the power to weight ratio is an impressive 271bhp/tonne. Such a fantastic power to weight ratio alone, of course, does not make a superlative track car, so the Exige Cup 260 had a formidable list of standard equipment that included Lotus specific LTS compound Yokohama A048R tires, 4-piston AP Racing front brake calipers, adjustable dampers and anti-roll bar.

A blend of avant-garde styling and ingenious engineering from Lotus Cars, the Evora shared the bonded aluminium technology pioneered on the Elise, which is now 14 years old. The Evora was built in three independent modules, comprising a central tub and sections for the front and rear. Although it shared its name with the ancient city of Évora, a World Heritage site about an hour and a half east of Lisbon, the name Evora was created by Lotus and derived from the words \"Evolution, Vogue, and Aura.\" The Evora's development was rapid by any standard. The initial sketches were penned in August 2006, and the first prototypes were being tested in early 2008. The disguises came off the prototypes after the unveiling in July 2008, and verification prototypes (VP) were being made in October. The first cars were scheduled for build in December of 2008. The first 16 production cars were earmarked as test mules to develop a federal version, with a view to producing the US car in October 2009.

Revealed to the public at the 2008 British Motor Show in London, the Evora had a sports-orientated suspension set-up, employing wishbones that were as light as those on the Elise but twice as stiff, and as a result, very expensive to develop. Despite the fact that the Evora was longer than the Elises, the intention was always that it should provide the same superb Lotus handling. The Elise was a familiar enough model to provide intelligible contrasts with the Evora. While both wheelbase and track on the Elise were significantly shorter than the Evora, and although the chassis, which weighed just 440lb, looked large, the Evora’s width was kept down by cleverly reducing the sill width, without compromising its overall strength.\n\nThe new car was powered by a 276bhp, 3.5-litre Toyota-sourced V6, monitored by Lotus’s own engine management system, driving through a manual six-speed Toyota gearbox.

The two-plus-two cabin provided space for a pair of adults in the front and two 5-footers in the back, and if you didn't want any rear seats in your Evora, you could opt for the Plus Zero version. Vehicle Engineering Director Roger Becker had been at Lotus for 42 years. \"Right now is a very special time,\" he said. \"We've had a bit of a dry spell for the last 13 years. The last brand new car that came out of Lotus was the Elise. That burst onto the scene and surprised everybody; it was a product that took Lotus back to its grass roots.\" The big cars—the Esprit V8s—had had their day, and it was time to revisit nimble cars like the Elan, which was under development when Becker joined the company in 1966. \"They were fantastic cars,\" he said, \"and I should know, because I broke a fair few in testing.

The project displayed a range of affordable green technologies that were intended to be feasible as well as production viable in the near term future, and focused on developments in sustainable materials, cleaner manufacturing processes, renewable energy generation, reducing carbon miles, efficient driving techniques, and of course, vehicle weight reduction. Capitalising on great strides forward in green technology, the Eco Elise project promoted a different perspective on \"green,\" one which did not revolve solely around tailpipe CO2. This holistic approach was keeping within the progressive Lotus culture, driving Lotus to become the world’s green automotive consultancy. Sustainable materials, hemp, eco wool, and sisal were developed for body panels and trim, and combined with hi-tech water-based paint solutions, showcased new affordable green technologies. The green credentials of the technology on show in the Eco Elise were analyzed throughout the lifecycle of the car. A green gear change display was integrated into the dashboard to promote greener driving, as well as a weight reduction program, illustrating the holistic approach taken.",

The \"265\" indicated the approximate horsepower of the vehicle, and the \"E\" indicated the environmentally favorable bioethanol E85 fuel (85% ethanol alcohol and 15% petrol) that powered the high-performing car. Key to this performance was a slightly modified version of the 2ZZ VVTL-i supercharged and intercooled engine as fitted to the standard Exige S. This gave performance figures that would thrash the majority of 'Super-Unleaded' performance cars: 0-60 mph in 3.88 seconds, 0-100 mph in 9.2 seconds, and a top speed of 158 mph. In fact, the Lotus Exige 265E was probably the world's quickest road-legal E85 bio-ethanol car. Ethanol has less stored energy per unit volume than gasoline, so the fuel economy is less. However, as E85 ethanol is 85 percent sourced from renewable bio matter, there is a net reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2). At the 2008 Geneva Show, Lotus showcased the even more powerful Exige 270E Tri-fuel. With similar performance figures to the 265E, but now with 270 bhp (at 8000 rpm), the 270E was capable of running on any mixture of gasoline, bioethanol, and methanol.",

The Tri-fuel Exige was part of Lotus' research to understand the complex combustion process involved in running on mixtures of alcohol fuels and gasoline, something which will become important if there is to be a successful transition from today's fuels to the sustainable, synthetic fuels of the future. Produced synthetically from CO2 and hydrogen, the use of Methanol (CH3OH), combined with emerging processes to recover atmospheric CO2, will ultimately provide the required carbon that can entirely balance the CO2 emissions resulting from the internal combustion of methanol. The result is that a car running on methanol, such as the Exige 270E, would be environmentally neutral. As well as being green, the great benefit of synthetic methanol is that it would use similar engines and fuel systems to those in current cars; and synthetic methanol can be stored, transported, and retailed in much the same way.",

Alongside the new model, Lotus also revealed the Evora IPS (Intelligent Precision Shift), which introduced a Lotus-developed six-speed automatic transmission. The Evora S featured Type 122 drive modes, and the driver had the option of selecting 'sport' mode, which provided a more sporting driving experience, allowing the driver to feel each gear shift while remaining in complete control of the transmission.\n\nCommenting on the development, Dany Bahar said: “The Evora IPS is set to broaden the appeal of the Evora and reach out to a slightly different market. We hope it will be popular with established automatic locations such as Asia, the Middle East, and the US. It has been a long time since Lotus created an automatic, and we’ve spent a great deal of time refining this one to make sure that it perfectly complements the Evora drive experience.”\n\n“The six-speed IPS system developed by Lotus is an option on both the standard Evora and the Evora S. In one way, IPS adapts to your driving style, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience.”",

The six-speed IPS system, developed by Lotus, is an option on both the standard Evora and the Evora S. In one way, IPS adapts to your driving style, ensuring the car is in exactly the right gear at the right moment to suit every situation. You steer, accelerate, and brake as normal; the IPS takes care of the rest. When you want more control, a pair of paddle shifts sit behind the steering wheel – flip right to change up, left to change down. And to avoid sudden engine braking, IPS induces ultra-quick throttle blipping during downshifts to harmonize engine and gearbox speeds. The driving modes on the IPS are controlled from the center console. Performance is characterized by smoothness, ride, handling, and power delivery.\n\nThe power unit on the Evora S saw a Harrop HTV1320 supercharger assembly (utilizing Eaton Twin Vortex Series (TVS) Technology) attached to the mid-mounted, DOHC, 24-valve, water-cooled aluminum 2GR-FE engine that still featured Dual-Variable Valve Timing operated by the Lotus-developed T6e engine control unit.

The technology demonstrator represents an encapsulation of the advanced technologies that Lotus Engineering continues to develop in an effort to overcome the current environmental challenges facing the automotive industry. It showcases the future direction that the sector is taking and why Lotus Engineering is perfectly placed to lead the technological development in this area. For the Evora 414E Hybrid, Lotus Engineering developed a highly efficient, high-performance drivetrain system consisting of twin motors each limited to providing 152 kW (204 bhp) of power and 295 lb-ft of torque to each wheel via independent, single-speed, reduction transmissions integrated into a single housing, enabling torque vectoring dynamic control of the vehicle. The vehicle energy storage system was made up of the latest Lithium Polymer battery chemistry, providing 17 kWh energy storage capacity. The battery pack was optimized for energy density, efficiency, and high power demand, with over 100 kW discharge capability. The Lotus Range Extender engine provided 35 kW (47 bhp) of power at 3,500 rpm via the integrated electrical generator and featured an innovative architecture comprising an aluminum monoblock construction, integrating the cylinder block, cylinder head, and exhaust manifold in one casting.",

This resulted in reduced engine mass, assembly costs, package size, and improved emissions and engine durability. The engine used an optimized two-valve, port-fuel injection combustion system to reduce cost and mass and could be operated on alcohol-based fuels and/or gasoline. \n\nThe generator converted mechanical energy to electrical energy to replenish the battery pack charge and provide additional vehicle range in a small, lightweight package. It was also used as a motor to start the range extender engine. The low mass of the range extender unit, at just 85 kg, and its compact package made it ideal for the series hybrid drivetrain in the Evora 414E. For everyday commuting journeys, up to 35 miles could be travelled using battery power. The battery could be charged overnight using a conventional domestic mains supply through a socket concealed by the rear number plate, allowing the vehicle to operate with zero tailpipe emissions. For longer journeys exceeding the battery range, the range extender engine would kick in, ensuring a seamless driving experience.",

When the FIA granted the team an entry into the 2010 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, it meant the Lotus name would be back on the Formula 1 grid for the first time since 1994, a season that had seen the Lotus Type 109 running in Grand Prix racing. The team was the second of three new Formula 1 teams for the 2010 season. Lotus Racing unveiled the T127 (Type 127) Grand Prix contender at London’s Royal Horticultural Halls in mid-February. The brainchild of Tony Fernandes, together with fellow shareholders Kamarudin Meranun and SM Nasarudin, they led a consortium of Malaysian business interests to join forces to provide initial funding for the team under the parent company 1Malaysia Racing Team. The new team had ties with the Lotus Cars brand through one of the team’s financial backers, Proton, who at the time owned the Lotus brand. The unveiling of the T127, interestingly named to fit within the Lotus Type number sequence despite the fact that the new team was not corporately linked to Lotus Cars, was attended by some of the team’s top big supporters. The T127 featured the following car stats: Engine: Renault R30, Chassis: Dallara, Transmission: 7-speed sequential gearbox, Suspension: Double wishbone front and rear, Brakes: Carbon-carbon disc brakes, Wheels: OZ Racing, Tires: Bridgestone Potenza.",

Joining Gascoyne in the launch of the new car were Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen, who were given the distinction of piloting the first Lotus cars to race in Formula 1 for 16 years.\n\nDevelopment of the 2010 car started late due to the late acceptance of the team's entry. On September 14, 2009, the first four people started work in what was essentially a bare, empty factory in Hingham, Norfolk, just 10 miles from the Lotus Cars HQ at Hethel. When Kovalainen visited the Lotus Racing factory for the first time, people were still building the walls and floors. By November, they had a mock engine design, were working with Fondtech on aerodynamics, and soon announced they would be using engines supplied by Cosworth, along with a 7-speed, longitudinal, semi-automatic gearbox.",

As the team had little data to work from, they were cautious with the cooling and had to design aspects such as the brake ducts to the maximum size. With no refueling for 2010, brakes were certainly going to be at a premium and brake-wear a significant factor.

The cell was wide, which compromised the radiators and substantially affected the aerodynamics on the four chassis that would be built during the year.\n\nFront and rear suspension followed accepted Formula 1 practice and was by double-wishbone and pushrod operated inboard springs and rockers, moderated by Penske dampers. The forged magnesium BBS wheels were 13-inch diameter at both the front and rear and wore the regulation Bridgestone Potenza rubber.

Although the carbon-fibre roof was listed as an option, it was also fitted with an FIA-approved fuel system and roll cage, a HANS-compliant carbon-fibre driver’s seat with a matching harness system, and a HANS-compliant passenger seat with a six-point harness. The Cosworth Omega instruments included a gear indicator. Other race-ready features included a sintered dual-plate clutch, Öhlins shock absorbers, and uni-ball wishbone joints for optimum adjustability. There were also Alcon six-piston race brake calipers on the front, and four-piston calipers on the rear, which clamped the two-piece discs with 22mm race pads. Forged aluminium 18x8.5-inch wheels in the front and 18x10-inch wheels in the rear completed the package and offered centre-hub spindles enabling quick changes at the track. To top off the race-car character of the Evora Enduro GT, it also came with a four-point air-jack system which lifted the car off the ground at the touch of a button and an ATL ‘dry break’ quick-fill 120-litre fuel tank linked to the FIA FT3 approved fuel system with an internal high-pressure pump, regulator, and filter. The rear wheels received their power from the following car stats: Model Type 124, Name/Formula Evora Enduro Racecar, Years of Production 2011, Examples Built 6, Engine Type Cosworth/Toyota V6 VVT-i 2GR-FE, Engine Size/Power 3995cc/440bhp, Length/Width/Height 171in/77.5in/47in, Wheelbase 101.5in, Weight 2557lb/1160kg.",

Power to the rear wheels was transmitted through an Xtrac 426 six-speed sequential transmission, mounted to a bespoke alloy cast bell housing, with a transverse layout dog engagement, reverse and neutral engagement, and an external oil cooler. This was reverse cut directly onto the primary shaft. An optional pneumatic paddle-shift system could also be fitted. The superb race handling was achieved through a forged double wishbone layout, four-way adjustable Öhlins TTX36 dampers, coaxial coil springs, increased camber, and adjustable anti-roll bars. These were all attached to the customary Lotus modular lightweight bonded aluminium chassis structure.\n\nIn March 2011, the Evora GTS made its debut as the race-going sibling of the Evora road car. Driven by Stefano d’Aste, Gianni Giudici, and Marco Fumagalli, the green and yellow Lotus Sport Italy car secured a solid victory in the GT Production class at the Monza 4-hour race.

A category which included the world-famous Le Mans 24-Hours, an event that had not seen an official Lotus supported entry since a pair of green and yellow Hugh Chamberlain Type 82 Esprit Sport 300s had competed in the 1994 running of the race. In the autumn of 2010, Lotus Motorsport announced hugely ambitious plans for the future, and by January of 2011, Austrian team JetAlliance Racing was announced as the official partner for the Evora GTE’s maiden season. Two cars were to be entered in the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup (ILMC), which included all the major endurance races such as the Sebring 12-Hours and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Given the short timeframe, the latest motorsport effort to come out of the Group Lotus organization proved to be one of the firm’s most ambitious yet. \"When we mentioned to the design team and some of our contractors that we were going to go to Le Mans, they didn’t think it would have 2011 in the date, they were looking at 2012!\" But everything that Lotus is doing is",

But everything that Lotus is doing at the moment is aggressive timing, and we're delivering everything that we say we're going to do,\" Lotus Motorsport Product Manager Gavan Kershaw stated. At first glance, the new GTE-spec Evora racecar may have seemed to have a similar appearance to the Evora GT4, which debuted in 2010, but as Kershaw explained, \"roughly 85 percent of the car is brand-new, with the production chassis remaining one of the only key components that's been carried over.\" With their Cosworth-tuned engines bored out from 3.5 to 4.0 litres and all-new bodywork as well as larger wheels and uprights, the Nicola Scimeca-designed Evora GTE was almost 120lb heavier than the GT4 model, yet was still considered a lightweight in the GTE racing category. Despite the engineering challenges, the program remained relatively on schedule, with the first Evora GTE hitting the track in early April and completing around 1,000 kilometers of testing.",

A further 700 miles were logged at the car's first public appearance, the one-day Le Mans test. Under the careful direction of Team Manager Jan Kalmar, the JetAlliance team fielded two cars in the 2011 Le Mans 24-hour race and, having qualified well in the new GTE class, both cars ran strongly. The number 64 car of Martin Rich, John Hartshorne, and Oskar Slinger retired on lap 127 when a broken wheel left the car stranded on track. Remarkably though, the number 65 car of Johnny Mowlem, James Rossiter, and Jonathan Hirschi lasted the full 24 hours and was classified 22nd overall.

Commenting on the Evora GTE road car, Group Lotus CEO Dany Bahar said: \"To celebrate our successful return to Le Mans this year, we created the ultimate road car racer. Initially, we hoped to introduce this to the Asian market with our partners in China as a 'taste of Lotus'. However, the response was so great that we received 114 orders from China alone. This justified us looking into speeding up the process of bringing this car to other territories. We showed a concept at Pebble Beach and are showing this production intent car at Frankfurt. We will bring this car to Europe and the US. People get so excited when they see and especially hear it for the first time. It's a very special car and will appeal to a very special type of driver – and they won't be disappointed!\"",
