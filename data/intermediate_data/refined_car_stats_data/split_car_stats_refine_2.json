While Jim Clark stuck with his Formula 1 based Type 33, Graham Hill piloted the prototype Type 48 and was running in third place when the crownwheel and pinion of the Hewland Mk5 gearbox failed at around half-distance, the transaxle being insufficiently strong for such a powerful engine.\n\n1967 Formula 2 Type 48",

        "content": "Few racing cars are as celebrated as the Formula 1 Lotus Type 49. Its racing record was creditable and championship-winning, but that is not the real reason for its fame. That lies in its engine, for the Type 49 was the first car to have the immortal Cosworth-Ford DFV V8 engine installed – the engine which would dominate Formula 1 for over a decade. Colin Chapman was instrumental in bringing the DFV engine to fruition. After a change in the Formula 1 regulations, he needed a new 3.0-litre engine for his forthcoming F1 car, and the BRM V8 and H16 engines used in 1966 were not altogether satisfactory. His long association with Cosworth – founding partners Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth had met at Lotus in 1957 – led him straight to their door. The trouble was raising the money to develop a new engine. Chapman managed to persuade Harley Copp, Ford of Britain’s Vice-President, Engineering, to make an initial investment of £100,000, as well as providing some specialist help. It was to be one of the best investments by a major manufacturer in the history of motor sport. Duckworth’s first step was to design the FVA four-cylinder engine for the following car stats:\n\n- Engine: Cosworth-Ford DFV V8\n- Engine Capacity: 3.0 litres\n- Notable Feature: First Formula 1 car with the DFV engine\n- Impact: Dominated Formula 1 for over a decade\n- Initial Investment: £100,000\n- Investor: Ford of Britain’s Vice-President, Engineering, Harley Copp\n- Design Lead: Keith Duckworth",

It was to be one of the best investments by a major manufacturer in the history of motor sport. Duckworth's first step was to design the FVA four-cylinder engine for Formula 2, as this would form the basis of a full Formula 1 V8 configuration engine. So the DFV engine was born: a compact 90-degree V8 with a stressed crankcase, which developed a quoted 400 bhp at 9,000 rpm.\n\nThe DFV evolved as a package with the Type 49 chassis, which was co-designed by Chapman and Maurice Philippe; as a result, the engine, gearbox, and chassis were beautifully integrated and as light as feasibly possible. Lotus said, 'a good deal less than a standard road-going Mini.' The engine acted as a chassis member, so that the monocoque became a simple nacelle, terminating immediately in front of the engine, which was carried on four mounting points. The low and narrow profile of the engine enabled the overall cross-section of the chassis to be kept to an absolute minimum. The chassis contained three aircraft-type flexible fuel cells with a capacity. \n\nCar stats:\n- Engine: DFV four-cylinder, 90-degree V8\n- Power: 400 bhp\n- RPM: 9,000\n- Chassis: Type 49\n- Fuel cells: Three aircraft-type flexible fuel cells",

The low and narrow profile of the engine enabled the overall cross-section of the chassis to be kept to an absolute minimum. The chassis contained three aircraft-type flexible fuel cells with a capacity of 40 gallons, feeding either to an engine-driven Lucas fuel pump or to an electrically driven pump for starting. A tubular subframe at the forward end of the monocoque carried the front suspension, steering, brake master cylinders, and so on; a reserve oil tank was carried over the driver's legs. The suspension was a familiar Lotus design, but there were new features. At the front, the top rocker arms were of deeper section yet considerably lighter. The cast magnesium uprights incorporated the steering arm and yet allowed the brake disc to extend outside the wheel profile for better cooling. Steering was by rack-and-pinion, now mounted low down. At the rear, triangulated tubular frames provided upper suspension pick-up points on the cylinder heads, and another frame under the ZF 5DS12 gearbox provided the lower mounts. The transmission incorporated sliding-spline joints within the output shafts. The lightweight wheels were new, designed for the car.",
