Recognising that the revolutionary Type 49 had only a very limited lifespan remaining, Colin Chapman was keen to produce an entirely new kind of car with which Team Lotus could win its fourth Formula One World Championship – a feat which had never yet been accomplished. Thus, the construction of a 4WD car was undertaken, and drew heavily on the experiences learned through the Type 56B project, which had used an all-wheel-drive system. The result was the Type 63, a vehicle which once again took Grand Prix car design to the very limits, and one whose unconventional layout pointed up the shape of things to come.\n\nOnce more, the power unit was the phenomenally successful Cosworth-designed and developed Ford DFV unit, but in every other respect, it was an entirely new machine.

Transfer gears then carried the drive to the left-hand side of the car where the main driveshafts to the front and rear axle units lay within the monocoque alongside the driver and engine. A complex arrangement, but an effective one, this layout ensured the most efficient disposition of the major masses in the car, allowing the fullest use to be made of the four-wheel-drive configuration.

With the effective exclusion of the gas turbine cars by air inlet restriction limits, Colin Chapman proposed a conventional rear-engined V8 layout but with the engine and gearbox reversed to accommodate 4-wheel drive, which would not be outlawed at Indy until 1970. Four-wheel-drive cars, however, were limited to maximum rim widths of ten inches at both front and rear – conventionally driven cars were allowed to run to fourteen. The resulting Type 64, known also as the STP-Oil Treatment Special, was shown to the press in late March 1969 before being flown out to the US for testing with Mario Andretti. Along with the regular Team Lotus Formula 1 drivers, Hill and Rindt, the press were told that Andretti would drive the new car at that year’s Brickyard event.

On the Hethel test track, chief mechanic Arthur Birchall found it almost impossible to control the power.

        "content": "Europa S2 had a revised bodyshell to suit a variety of minor modifications, the most obvious being the raised front wing and headlamp profile, to comply with US regulations. New doors incorporated fresh internal and external locks and handles, the wiring loom was modified to suit the fitment of brake fail lights and hazard warning lights, and the demisters were modified. The Federal-spec Europa was first produced in March 1969 as a 1970 model year car, and put on the market at a price of $4295, some $500 less than the Elan S4 had been. Shortly after introduction, further small changes were made, such as revised headlamp pods, a new windscreen wiper motor complete with new arms and blades, heater mounting bracket, and finally – alongside the change to a bonded windscreen, new indicators, hazard flasher units, and fan motor relay. The Federal S2 was only withdrawn in December 1971, some months after the last European Series 2 car had been built, and by that stage, a total of 865 Series 2 Europas had been made to US Federal specifications.",
