Holbay, the engine tuning company from Suffolk, modified the unit by fitting a high-lift camshaft, a pair of twin-choke, side-draught 40 DCOE2 carburettors and a free flow manifold, and called it the CFR1600. This gave the same power as the previous ‘pre-crossflow’ unit in its highest state of road tune. A new luxury model called the Lotus Seven ‘S’ with this engine and better appointments, even including a radio, was displayed at the Racing Car Show of 1969. However, with a price tag of £1600 fully assembled, it did not promise strong sales potential and thus the show model was the only one made. Even so, according to the factory records, CFR1600 power units were fitted into some cars. Although production of the Series Three finished in November 1969, the remaining stock of cars and parts meant cars continued to be sold well into 1970. All in all, about 340 Series 3 cars were made in a period of around just fifteen months.",

In 1968, the Rob Walker team took delivery of chassis 49B/R7 on the eve of the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Jo Siffert, who had already destroyed one Type 49 at Brands earlier in the year, played himself in gently during first practice, but picked up the tempo and qualified a strong fourth on the grid for his 'first race' in a truly competitive car. With Graham Hill and Jackie Oliver occupying the first two slots on the grid, in the Team cars, things were looking good for a Lotus victory, and Siffert was hoping to be able to follow the works car home and at least finish in third place.

In 1969, Jochen Rindt joined Team Lotus and, after a hard season, secured his first Grand Prix win in the 49B at Watkins Glen. Although Hill had won again at Monaco, the 49B had not lived up to the previous season's triumphs. With an upswept tail-cover that enclosed the repositioned oil tank and high-level oil cooler, the new 49B had a more pronounced Type 56-style wedge profile. A slightly longer wheelbase was achieved by raking the front suspension arms forwards, and a tougher rear suspension subframe which carried the new Hewland FG400 gearbox relieved the cylinder heads of their suspension load duties. Larger wheels and adjustable front aerofoils completed the package for that first race at Monaco, but the 49B would later evolve.\n\nIn early 1968, Colin Chapman had been working on a redesign of the Type 49, dubbed the 49B, but the loss of Jim Clark at Hockenheim delayed an intended early season launch of the new car until the Monaco Grand Prix in May.

Some believed this change was due to the new government taxation systems, which would eventually do away with the Purchase Tax and bring in the new VAT tax, as well as the desire of Colin Chapman for Lotus to move up-market. He felt that offering \"Kit\" cars was not the image Lotus needed to move forward into a new era. Thus, in an attempt to push the car up-market (more luxurious and more appealing), all +2S cars would be factory built and assembled.

However, a car with a Cosworth modified twin-cam engine left the Cheshunt factory as early as March 1965, bound for Australian dealer Leo Geoghegan, for use in an Australian race series. Over the next few years, several Series 2 owners had figured out how to install the Twin-cam engine into their cars, and in early 1969, Graham Nearn took one of these cars to Hethel to show the factory that it really could be done. Lotus Components, rather than Lotus Cars, took up the challenge and made a production version based on the Series 3 chassis and called it the Twin-Cam SS (Super Seven). The first of these cars, an ivory white show car, was displayed on the Lotus stand at the 1969 Motor Show at Earls Court in October of 1969. This was a different Seven indeed with plush carpeting and trim that included improved contour padded seating in grey PVC, engraved aluminium dashboard (including World Champion Constructors badge), rocker switches, semi-flush rear lights recessed into the mudguards, and slatted Series 3.",

The Holbay modified big valve Twin-cam engine produced 124 bhp at 6200 rpm, giving the car scorching performance with 0-60 mph coming in just 7.1 seconds and a top speed of 111 mph. With all this power, it was deemed prudent for a new stronger 'SS80' chassis to be made. To increase chassis strength, triangulation was added both around the bottom of the engine bay and to the chassis sides. In addition, steel side panels were welded directly to the frame, something which was to become a feature of the future Series Four model.\n\nDuring the show, Graham Nearn took enough deposits for another dozen cars to be made. However, at that price of £1225 in kit-form, the Twin-cam SS was expensive and only 13 would officially be built (with the strengthened chassis, painted grey, but without the steel side panels).",

Warner's plans, though, were more grandiose than just another refitting of the existing Seven, which still looked much as it had when launched in 1957. This would be virtually an all-new car, to be sold through an all-new dealer network to a much wider public. Part of the plan was also to make the previously loss-making Seven cheaper to produce.\n\nWarner set Peter Lucas and Alan Barrett to work on the new Lotus Type 60 in March 1969, and the prototype was completed only seven months later. Lucas designed a simple new spaceframe chassis with spot-welded flat steel cockpit and engine bay sides plus a folded steel front cross-member. It was built by Arch Motors, with some additional chassis by Griston Engineering. The bodywork was drastically new. Stylist Alan Barrett created a longer and wider shape which eschewed aluminium for self-coloured glass-fibre construction. The rear wings, scuttle, and dashboard were integral mouldings, while the new-profile GRP wings and large tilt-forward bonnet were separate panels. All the GRP bodywork was built in-house.",

Free-standing headlamps were supplemented by nose-mounted indicators, later moved to a more prominent position on the wings.\n\nMechanically, the S4 also took many new directions. The rear axle remained Ford Escort but was now located by Watts linkages and a single triangulated arm for lateral location. As before, there were coil/spring damper units front and rear, but the front suspension was based on the Lotus Europa. Only the very earliest S4 models had no anti-roll bar fitted. Brakes were carried over, but the steering reverted to Burman rack-and-pinion.\n\nThe engines offered in the S4 were the Ford 1600 (or more rarely 1300) units and the Lotus Twin-Cam (115bhp) and Holbay Big Valve Twin-Cam (125bhp). The Ford 1300 unit was an awkward fit, and indeed, one of the chassis tubes had to be cut away to get it in. A Ford Corsair gearbox was used.",

Perhaps the most attractive feature of the S4 was its interior. Notably more spacious, it featured better seats (adjustable on export models), improved sidescreens with perspex sliding panels, and a moulded dash with no fewer than six gauges fitted. There was even an optional hard-top, of which very few were ever built.

However, it is true that sales never remotely reached the 2000-per-year mark at which Warner had been aiming. Export markets did not respond with the expected enthusiasm, and the USA market was never exploited due to Federal emissions and safety laws. Mike Warner left Lotus Racing in April 1971 to be replaced by John Standen, whose task it was to wind down Lotus Racing. As a result, production of the Seven transferred across to the main Lotus Cars facility in late 1971 where it sat uncomfortably with the Elan.
