Ford got Parnelli Jones to accompany Clark at Trenton, and while Clark retired with engine trouble, Jones won convincingly. Foyt joined Jones to drive in the USAC race at Milwaukee (Clark and Gurney were in the Austrian GP that weekend), and Jones led the race from start to finish; Foyt retired after a gear-shift bracket failed. In 1965, the surviving Type 34s were campaigned by Jones and Foyt, and at the Indy 500 that year, Foyt in his 'Sheraton-Thompson Special' took pole position and Jones fourth, surrounded by other Lotus cars. All five top grid positions were taken by Lotus that year, with Clark in the new Type 38 second on the grid. When a suspension upright failed on Jones' car, the USAC Safety Committee grounded not only the non-works Type 34s but the new Type 38s as well, making Colin Chapman understandably furious. With new uprights fitted on all five Lotus entries, a low-on-fuel Jones succeeded in eking out a superb second place to Clark's winning Type 38; Foyt retired with transmission failure.",

The design was essentially a logical evolution of the 1963 Formula Junior Type 27 and the later Type 32. It was about four inches longer but very similar in external appearance. The monocoque hull was made of high-strength sheet steel, together with steel load-bearing box members at each end, and with aluminum integral side panels. At the front, wide-based lower wishbones were used in conjunction with F1 cast uprights similar to the Lotus 24 and 25 cars. At the rear, a pair of non-parallel twin radius rods were fitted on taller rear uprights. As with the 32, the suspension was made fully adjustable after all the problems experienced with the Formula Junior 27s and their limited adjustment suspension.\n\nColin Chapman decided that it would be a useful exercise to build a car that could take various power units, enabling it to race in several formulae. In fact, seven different engine variations were possible. The standard unit was the Formula 2 Cosworth SCA 1000cc.

Although Lotus Components also listed the fuel-injected 1000cc BRM twin-cam unit for Formula 2, the Type 35 could also be used in the American Formula B Series when a 150bhp 1.6-litre Lotus-Ford Twin-cam would be fitted. Lotus Components listed other options, namely a Cosworth 1.5-litre twin-cam, as well as a Formula 3 specification 1-litre Cosworth MAE engine. There was also a listing on the official Team Lotus specification sheet for a Tasman Formula version of the car. With a little work, it was possible to modify the car to take the Coventry Climax FPF four-cylinder 2.5-litre engine.

Team Lotus’ Formula 2 participation for 1965 was again looked after by Ron Harris. The early part of the 1965 season saw the official team running a combination of both 32s and 35s, but as the factory completed more new cars, the obsolete 32s were retired and the new 35s, proving far superior, took their place. The unfortunate problem was that the Type 35 was not as fast in a straight line as the rivals, despite the fact that the engines used produced between 117bhp and 124bhp from only 1.0-litre.

This was enough to win both The Autocar Championship and the Grands Prix de France series. The five Lotus victories matched the number of Brabham wins that season.

Lotus therefore built a new chassis, number R12 in the 25/33 sequence, with notably wider sides and no rear chassis legs. Then the unexpected happened. Coventry Climax encountered endless delays and teething problems with its flat-16 and eventually announced that any further development would be reluctantly abandoned (its existing V8 was, in any case, proving to be the dominant power plant in F1). So Lotus had built a sleek one-off monocoque for an engine that would sadly never run.\n\nIn 1965, Lotus constructed the Type 39 as its new Formula 1 contender. The whole project centred around a brand new flat-16 engine being developed by Coventry Climax, the FWMW. This fantastically complex but compact unit was designed to offer a lower centre of gravity without requiring a major chassis redesign.
