As the circus moved north to Australia, Clark was in a rather disappointing seventh place overall, but there was some consolation ahead. At Warwick Farm, a course which favored the old four-cylinder Climax engine, Clark won his first and only victory of the series, elevating him to second in the championship behind Stewart. However, this performance could not be sustained, and despite a second place at Sandown Park, he could only finish the series in a disappointing third place, behind the two BRMs of Stewart and Hill. Australian Lotus agent Leo Geoghegan had taken a liking to the Type 39, and immediately after the final race of the series, he acquired it from Chapman. He was the only owner-driver in the front rank of Australian racing at the time and went on to make a big impression with the car, which was repainted white with his sponsor Total Oil's blue and red stripes.

One of the very first was the so-called Lotus 7½, which was developed (unofficially) at Cheshunt by Lotus engineers Hugh Haskell and Don Gadd for the 1962 racing season. A Seven Series 1 chassis was strengthened and fitted with adjustable double wishbone front suspension, while at the rear a fully independent set-up was based around an Eleven differential (Elite in the case of the subsequent four cars built) with Lotus Type rear 20 hub assemblies. Fitted with a Cosworth-prepared Ford 105E engine, these advanced Sevens were extremely quick cars and raced with great success throughout 1962 and 1963. Colin Chapman even enjoyed one of his last competitive outings as a driver in the 7½ when he competed in the 1962 Silverstone Six-Hour Relay race.\n\nFollowing this semi-official Seven was another development in the same vein, but it was given a proper Lotus Type number, 37. Although it was based around the Seven, it was always known as the Lotus Three-7. This project was conceived as a new-generation Clubmans racer for the 1965 season. The Clubmans Formula had been a staple for many years, and the new Lotus Type 37 was designed to continue this tradition.

The Clubmans Formula had been introduced by the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC) and British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) in 1964, to provide a championship for cars such as the Seven which were being outclassed by specialized mid-engined machinery in sports car racing. The Formula was based around open-wheeled two-seaters with a front-mounted Ford engine. Lotus 7s were a popular choice and highly competitive, but not as successful as the Arthur Mallock-designed Mallock U2. Perhaps this provided the necessary incentive to create a serious Lotus challenge in this formula, as Lotus was so dominant in just about every other formula in which it competed.

While Colin Chapman was busy attending the Tasman Championship, Len Terry was called on to do the design work for a revised Indy contender, the Type 38, on which the chassis was for the first time a full ‘stressed-skin tube’ monocoque. The chassis frame was considerably stiffer than any previous Lotus single-seater, hopefully offering somewhat more crash protection for the driver should there be contact with the unforgiving wall at Indy, but it still weighed only 130 lb. The chassis contained a rear-mounted fuel reservoir tank fed by three separate inner diaphragms forming the fuel tank bays: two full-length ones each side and one behind the seat. This allowed fuel capacity to increase by 40 percent with no expansion in terms of overall width or height. The Type 38’s shape was much smoother than the 1963 and 1964 cars, with no abrupt change of section at any point.

Indeed, Clark thought he had won the race, but then discovered that Graham Hill's Lola had passed him during an early spin during which he had miraculously avoided hitting the wall, and after much debate, he and the team were convinced they should accept second place behind Hill. There was still life in the Type 38, as Bobby Unser proved by finishing second at the Mount Fuji race in Japan in October 1966. The following year, with the new BRM H16-powered Type 42 cars proving problematical, Clark again raced a Type 38 at Indy.

Dan Gurney was not with the team that year; he raced in a Yamaha-backed Type 38 under the Gurney/Shelby All-American Racers banner.

The bodywork was similar to the 1930s, differing most notably in its rear cut-outs for a pair of upward-angled exhaust megaphones, a new rear spoiler, and a slightly longer nose. Other changes included a repositioned oil cooler, slightly larger 11.25-inch ventilated disc brakes, and twin fuel fillers. Team Lotus took a single Type 40 to the bumpy Zeltweg Aerodrome for the car’s debut at the Austrian Grand Prix meeting; this was August 1965 and, although it was quite late in the season, the car was patently not ready for a full racing program. Despite the shortcomings, Mike Spence took pole position, with a lap time some 2.1 seconds inside Dan Gurney’s Formula 1 record, and led for 13 laps before an overheating engine forced him out. The car had frankly been a handful in the race and clearly needed sorting. Some urgent work at Cheshunt saw a revised Type 40 delivered to the International Guards Trophy at Brands Hatch on 30th August with just five minutes of practice time remaining. On this occasion, Jim Clark was the driver, but he too had a hard time in the car, spinning twice in his first heat before retiring.",

Evidently, the Type 40 was still a bit of a handful! Team Lotus then took the 40 to the USA, with Clark and American driver Richie Ginther being the works pilots in a single event in the West Coast series, the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix. At Silverstone, test driver Jack Sears ran comparison tests between the progressive Dunlop tyres and the more grippy Firestones. During testing, he rolled his car after colliding with a bank and was so badly injured that he missed the 1966 season and effectively retired from racing. In the Riverside race itself, Clark mustered a second place, some nine seconds behind Hap Sharp’s Chaparral, while Ginther retired early with transmission problems. Nevertheless, Clark’s second placing stands as the Type 40’s best result in a year dominated by stiff competition from the McLarens.",

The third and final Lotus 40 was the pale blue Holman & Moody car of A.J. Foyt. This car was wrecked in practice at Riverside by Holman & Moody mechanic and test driver Bob Tattersall. The team managed to rebuild the car in time for the Bahamas Speed Week in Nassau, but it had too-soft suspension settings and the car reputedly “fell to pieces” on the bumpy track. The Type 40 had something of an evil reputation with its drivers. Jack Sears called it “hard work – a very highly-strung and twitchy car.” And a contemporary report even cited that Jim Clark was heard muttering some very unkind things about the untested car. Lotus Components put its two works cars up for sale in April 1966 at £3750 each, fully race-prepared. Over the next few seasons, nobody felt the Type 40 could be made competitive and their racing potential was limited.",

In addition, weight was not usually a factor, as many cars were having to add ballast to get up to the minimum. For 1966, Lotus decided to revert to the tried and tested steel tubular spaceframe for its new Type 41. This car was built for Formula 3 applications, in addition to Formula Libre and US Formula B specifications. Original press releases stated that the Type 41 would also be produced for Formula 2 for 1966, but Lotus went on to produce the monocoque Type 44 instead. Australian John Joyce was given the design assignment, assisted by Dave Baldwin. It has been said that the chassis was a development of the 22/31 frame, but a side-by-side inspection shows that Joyce started with a clean sheet of paper. The most notable feature of this new design was the extensive use of stressed steel panels in the bulkheads, with welded steel around the footwell, double-sided steel around the instrument panel.",

Floors were also welded in for additional stiffness. In the usual Lotus fashion, water and oil were carried in the main chassis rails between the engine and radiators. A very clever system was devised to use the rear bulkhead as an oil overflow collector. Even the front oil tank had its overflow routed through a labyrinthine path using chassis tubes, all the way to the rear end.\n\nSuspension was fairly typical Lotus design, with one major difference: it was wider than normal. The A-arms were lengthened, producing a stance more reminiscent of an F1 car of the day. Type 33 six-spoke, six-bolt magnesium wheels were used in 7-inch and 9-inch widths. In early production, the rear uprights from the Type 22/23 were used, but later on, wider stance components unique to the 41 were fitted.\n\nThe car stats are as follows: Model: Type 41, Name/Formula: Formula 3/Formula B, Years of Production: 1966-, Examples Built: 61, Engine Type: Cosworth-Ford MAE, Engine Size/Power: 997cc/115bhp, Length/Width/Height: 144in/66in/27in, Wheelbase: 90in, Weight: 926lb/420kg.",

The Type 41 also boasted a reduced frontal area due to the smaller radiator and very sleek wind-tunnel-tested bodywork; these conspired to make the cockpit considerably more cramped than the previous Formula Junior and Formula 3 models. Most customers in the first year opted for the Cosworth MAE engine, driving through a Hewland Mk6 4-speed gearbox. The gear lever was on the right-hand side and proved to be very difficult to operate due to the chassis reinforcing tube that interfered with the lever, as well as the confined driving position. In a rather ineffective design change after the 1966 season, this tube was sectioned and routed downwards, and then back up to give some room for the shift lever to move.

Courage would go on to take the Craven 'A' Championship in France. Other drivers with good results in 1966 were American driver Peter Revson, Derek Bell, and Mo Nunn. However, the season was dominated by the Brabham BT18, which led to the conclusion that the Type 41 was not on par. But the records show that good results were common in races where there was a serious privateer team present.
