Thus, the Type 55 concept was shelved, and a totally new design, the Type 59, was pushed through for use in Formula 3 for 1969. In early 1969, the Type 41X and a complete set of spares were advertised by Team Lotus (along with the works Type 47) for sale in Autosport. The highly distinctive car—the only 'works' Formula 3 Lotus to use high wings—was sold to a competitor in Italy who raced the car for several seasons before it fell into neglect. Discovered several years later by an Italian Lotus enthusiast, the car remains in Italy and has undergone a full restoration.",

However, the twin-cam engine in this format did not rev as freely as it had with the Webers, and after nine months of production, it reverted back to Webers for the UK market at least. Therefore, Webers made a welcome return with eight-port heads, although in true Lotus tradition, and in an attempt to use a cheaper item available on the market, Dellorto carburetors were still installed in some cars manufactured after this point. All federalized versions of the Elan S4 had the Zenith-Stromberg carburation with cross-over inlet pipes in the engine bay, as well as a single large earless wheel nut instead of three-eared knock-on type, side marker lights on the front and rear wings, and a door-mounted bullet rear view mirror. Many of these changes were brought about by the need to conform to the safety and emission laws being introduced primarily in the United States, including items such as the rocker-type switches on the dashboard, a collapsible steering column, and the need for larger rear light units. Shortly after the launch of the new model, a significant refinement was made.",

Shortly after the launch of the new model, a significant revision to the bodywork was brought on by a change in the engine bay from Weber to Stromberg carburettors. This happened after Colin Chapman discovered that the Stromberg carburettor was significantly cheaper than the Weber units they had been using until now, as well as helping slightly with the extensive testing needed for emissions requirements in the USA. He directed engineers to make whatever alterations were necessary to accommodate the change, and the S4 went on sale complete with twin Stromberg carburettors and a distinctive bonnet bulge (just visible on the yellow car below). When it was officially launched at the 1968 London Motor Show, the Series 4 Elan also featured several changes that were prompted by new US Federal regulations. The new improved Elan Series 4, in both Type 36 fixed-head and Type 45 drop-head variations, was revealed to the public in March 1968.

Certainly a unique project, the Europa 47D was a very special one-off car built by Lotus for the GKN/Vandervell group of companies which were scattered throughout the world, and who produced all manner of things from nuts and bolts through to pig troughs, in places as far apart as Birmingham and Australia. One of the companies within the group, Vandervell Products Ltd, had built and raced the famous Vanwall Formula 1 Grand Prix cars with which Britain dominated the Grand Prix scene some ten years or so before, and Colin Chapman had helped on the design of their most successful car.

A smaller flywheel was made by one of the companies under the GKN umbrella; obviously, it needed a smaller clutch. A smaller clutch, naturally, would not easily cope with the power. Borg and Beck were consulted and cooperated to produce a special one-off clutch for GKN: a special 7-inch twin-plate clutch which, naturally, then needed a different bell-housing.

Fitting the engine and transmission installation to the chassis meant that the rear suspension had to be revised; both the length and the position of the radius rods had to be altered, and with the engine around half a hundredweight heavier than the Ford Twin-cam unit which was standard on the Lotus 47, quite a lot of experimentation had to be carried out to achieve a satisfactory spring rate.

Leonard led the race briefly, but Hill retired early after hitting a wall when the front suspension failed. Leonard, fighting back from second place, led once more and with fewer than a dozen laps left to run looked set to take the flag until, with just nine laps remaining, his turbine died. Pollard had retired too, his turbine also having died. In both cases, the fault was the same: failure of the fuel-pump drive. Ironically, while Lotus had requested to run with steel driveshafts in the pump, the units' manufacturer had fitted phosphor bronze items to the pumps on the other two cars, both of which had failed. Significantly, only Hill's car (on which the turbine had not failed) retained the steel originals. For two consecutive years, a gas turbine car had nearly won the Memorial Day Classic, something the American authorities were not in the least happy about. With Colin Chapman's attention now elsewhere, Andy Granatelli continued to campaign the Type 56 at other USAC races throughout the 1968 season, but with little success.

The intention was to utilize de Dion axles and suspension located in a lightweight tubular frame chassis at both front and rear. At the rear, this would be in place of the traditional but comparatively heavy Lotus beam style of de Dion axle, seen on earlier cars such as the Eleven and Twelve. It had never been used at the front end before. Confusingly, the Type 58 was the first of the two cars to actually appear. It was designed by Martin Waide and built during 1968 to house a conventional 1600cc Cosworth FVA engine. Shown in the new Gold Leaf Team Lotus colors – aside from later versions of the Type 48 which raced in the Tasman Series, the first time this striking livery had been seen – it was intended to be tested by Jim Clark the week after his return from the Hockenheim Formula Two race in April 1968.

The FVA engined car is known to have run in testing at Hethel with Graham Hill driving, and possibly at Snetterton with both Hill and John Miles behind the wheel. In Formula Two guise, the car was reported to handle beautifully and predictably, but it was by any standards too slow to be competitive. With a distinct lack of enthusiasm for Formula 2 within Team Lotus, the project was dropped and taken no further in this form. Instead, later in the year, and substantially revised, the solitary Type 58 chassis was completely rebuilt as a prototype, fully finished to Formula One specification, whereupon it emerged as the Type 57.

However, the Englishman, while covering considerable mileage in the car, did not apparently enjoy the Type 57 experience and so instead, both he and new recruit Jochen Rindt took their Type 49Ts 'down-under' to contest the 1969 Tasman series. The innovative deDion concept was thus shelved and, although the car survived in its final form, it never ran again, until over 30 years later that is. In 1999, Clive Chapman at Classic Team Lotus made the decision to rescue the car from the Lotus stores, where it had been languishing for over three decades and have the car restored to its former glory and its place in Lotus history as the first true wedge profile car.

The new head of Lotus Components, Mike Warner, wanted to develop a radically new Seven, but the board members at Lotus favored an evolution of the existing Series 2. By 1968, Ford had brought out a new power unit for their European range of cars, and the faithful old 105E and 116E engines were now becoming difficult to source new, in any reasonable quantity. The new 225E crossflow engine came in two sizes, 1598cc and 1297cc, and was installed in the Seven in standard form with a single Weber 28/36 progressive downdraft carburettor. These units, producing 72bhp and 84bhp respectively, were fitted to the last of the production of Series 2 cars from the beginning of 1968. Still retaining the Standard 10 axle, this model was dubbed the 'Series 2½'.

The old Standard Ten axle, which was weaker than the Nash Metropolitan item used in the Series 1 Seven, was not really designed to take the 100 bhp now being put through it, especially as the method of location asked a lot of the casing. In addition to this, the significant advance of tyre technology in the 1960s had put considerably more strain on the half-shafts. So, from September 1968, a new model incorporating the much stronger axle from Ford’s successful Escort Mexico was produced. This was then the first Seven to have an all-Ford drive train.\n\nThe many 'improvements' that came with the new car included: black carpet, upholstery, and trim instead of the traditional red; a fuel filler on the outside of the body instead of it being in the boot space; the luxury of a fuel gauge rather than the notched stick previously required; direction indicators as standard equipment; both speedometer and rev-counter in front of the driver rather than the former being directly in front of the passenger.\n\nWith the Ford axle came the wider 5½ x 13-inch wheels.

With the Ford axle came the wider 5½ x 13-inch wheels from the Lotus Cortina and, of course, the new Lotus Type 51 Formula Ford cars, which in turn could be shod with modern radial tires. These wider wheels and wider rear axle meant that wider rear wings were required, giving the car a more aggressive look at the back. Later during the production of the Series Three, cast aluminum wheels from Dunlop were offered as an optional extra (see yellow car below).\n\nIn the engine department, the new Ford crossflow, in its standard state of tune, did not excite a lot, as the engine in the previous model had produced as much as 120bhp (Cosworth Mark IX). Holbay, the engine tuning company from Suffolk, modified the unit by fitting a high-lift camshaft, a pair of twin-choke, side-draft 40DCOE2 carburetors, and a free-flow manifold, calling it the CFR1600. This modification gave the same power as the previous 'pre-crossflow'.",
