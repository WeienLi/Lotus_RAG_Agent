It's a very special car and will appeal to a very special type of driver – and they won't be disappointed! Producing over 444 bhp from the race-developed Evora GTE's supercharged V6 engine, this was, quite simply, set to be the most powerful Lotus road car that had ever been built. Transferring this power to the road, through a sequential AMT racing gearbox, were lightweight, forged alloy rims, with center lock hubs shod with Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tires. Yet, contrary to its extreme roots, the Evora GTE road car was also set to deliver a comfortable and refined element to its high performance driving characteristics.\n\nEvora GTE Concept Car:\nType: 122\nName/Formula: Evora GTE Concept Car\nYears of Production: 2011\nExamples Built: 30 (20 converted to 350GT)\nEngine Type: Supercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nEngine Size/Power: 3456cc/444 bhp\nLength/Width/Height: 172 in/77.5 in/45 in\nWheelbase: 101.5 in\nWeight: 2623 lb/1190 kg\n\nTo fit with the Lotus Lightweight DNA, clever use of carbon-fiber was integrated extensively throughout the exterior and interior of the car, and this was one of the major contributors to the 230 lb weight reduction versus the base Evora.

By 2012, however, the F1 team based out of Norfolk would be rebranded as Caterham F1. On October 5th, 2010, the team announced that they had agreed to a deal with Red Bull Technology for the supply of their seven-speed, semi-automatic gearbox and hydraulic systems for 2011. On November 5th, the team confirmed an engine partnership for the next two years with Renault, and on November 30th, the FIA released the entry list for the 2011 season in which the former Lotus Racing was listed under the name “Team Lotus.”\n\nOne of the most striking details of the Lotus TL11 (T128) was its lack of a roll hoop, in its place a ‘blade’.

It was said that this approach gave the all-important and much cleaner airflow to the rear wing. After the MGP W01 version was fully revealed at the Spanish Grand Prix, queries were raised about the safety of the concept: would the blade dig into the ground in a rollover? The rule makers took heed, and the following appeared in the 2011 technical regulations: 15.2.4 The principal roll structure must have a minimum enclosed structural cross section of 10,000 mm², in vertical projection, across a horizontal plane 50 mm below its highest point. The area thus established must not exceed 200 mm in length or width and may not be less than 10,000 mm² below this point.

It could be said that this was the latest in a long line of innovations from Team Lotus.

In common with the Exige S, the Roadster also came with two different suspension settings: a standard suspension for an active driving experience, suited for public roads, and an optional setting as part of the Race Pack, developed for maximum performance during track use. Despite the fact that the Roadster lost over 150lb compared to the coupé, which was now weighing in at 2570lb and being one of the lightest six-cylinder roadsters on the market by some margin, the 0-60 time remained the same at 3.8 seconds, as did the 0-100mph figure of 8.5 seconds.

The livery was slightly different from the previous year's, with the new car featuring a black, gold, and red livery with more visible red on the sidepods, air intake, rear wing, and front wing compared to the 2012 car, where red only featured as Total oil and fuel branding. Very much a logical development of the previous year's car, the design team on the E21, again led by Martin Tolliday, produced another car that was easy on its tires and rode somewhat softly. The overall package was naturally very similar to the E20, with power for the E21 coming from the 2013 version of the 2.4-liter, 90-degree V8 Renault RS27 unit. The 7-speed gearbox was now designated as a bespoke Lotus-built unit rather than in conjunction with X-Trac as on the 2012 car. AP Racing again provided the clutch and brake calipers, although for this year Carbone rather than Hitco supplied the pads and discs.\n\nThe major change in philosophy of the E21 in comparison to the E20 was in the sidepod/exhaust configuration.

From the first concept, the E21 featured a Red Bull style, steeply ramped sidepod and lower inlet tunnel area. The 2013 system fed airflow from the bottom of the sidepod, keeping it separate from the exhaust flow used to blow the brake ducts and diffuser sides. From the Malaysia race onwards, this feature of the car's design received updates with an exhaust arrangement that brought it further forwards in the car, allowing a steeper ramp that did less to compromise the 'coke-bottle' profile of the lower rear bodywork. The team also continued to lead the way on the development of the front wing endplate area that helped guide air around the front tires.

This allowed for Touring, Sport, and Race settings on the engine and enabled the 2,470lb race car to accelerate from zero to 62mph in just 3.8 vision-blurring seconds. Equipped with fully adjustable double-wishbone suspension with anti-roll bars both front and rear, the V6 Cup rode on special 5-Y-spoke diamond cut 17 and 18-inch wheels, fitted with Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo tyres (205/45R17 front and 264/40R18 rear).",

Announced in the press at the very end of 2012 but not available until 2013, one solution found was the addition of a new 'Sports Racer' option. The package brought the sports car new styling inside and out, as well as several new technical features.\n\nThe Evora Sports Racer could be ordered in both naturally aspirated and supercharged versions. In the naturally aspirated format, the 3.5-litre, DOHC V6 engine delivered 276 bhp, whilst in the supercharged edition, this increased to 345 bhp at 7,000 rpm and 295 lb ft of torque at 4,500 rpm. According to the official announcement, the new Evora Sports Racer, as delivered, \"proves its value on the pocket, as well as on the road and track—it delivers phenomenal performance, exclusive style, incredible excitement, and genuine affordability.\" On the British market, the car was priced at £57,900 for the naturally aspirated version (around $94,300 at the time) and £65,900 ($107,300) for the supercharged edition.

These included the introduction of a complicated turbo and hybrid drivetrain as well as more subtle changes to the aero regulations that prompted the adoption of a distinctive new nose. First revealed to the public at the pre-season test in Bahrain on the 19th of February, just hours after it was announced that Lotus team principal Eric Boullier had stepped down, the new Lotus, dubbed E22, featured conventional front and rear suspension with, as in the previous two seasons, push-rod actuated dampers at the front and pull-rods at the rear.\n\nOver the past few years and in efforts to improve aero efficiency, Formula 1 designers had gradually developed raised noses but, for safety reasons, the new regulations from the FIA stipulated the use of a lower nose. This resulted in some very unusual creations, of which the Lotus F1 two-fingered configuration was probably the most unusual.",

However, for safety reasons, the new regulations from the FIA stipulated the use of a lower nose. This resulted in some very unusual creations, of which the Lotus F1 two-fingered configuration was probably the most unusual. Sure to prove controversial, the car's new split-nose design was designed by Lotus to meet the new regulations dictating that the front wings were 150mm narrower. Although initial concerns over its legality were raised, it was deemed to meet the regulations. The chassis was designed by Nick Chester, Chris Cooney, Martin Tolliday, and Nicolas Hennel, with Renault again supplying the team's powertrain. The E22 was designed to use Renault's all-new, 1.6-litre, 24-valve V6 turbocharged engine, the Energy F1-2014. This would be the last car from the Enstone-based team to use Renault engines before a new one-year deal with fellow Daimler brand Mercedes came into force for 2015. The team's troubled financial situation, which was primarily responsible for the late start to the E22's build program, meant the team was forced to miss the first pre-season test at Jerez de la Frontera.

On sale in early 2015, it integrated smooth and intuitive gear shifts with engine response and exhaust note. The Exige S Automatic provided its driver with all-round engagement and excitement, reflecting the Lotus DNA of pure driving experience. For drivers who were hoping to enjoy a more spirited drive, the gearshift characteristics were calibrated to reflect the dynamic system changes that were activated when the driver selected either 'Sport' or 'Race' mode. Optimized gear selection and response delivered quicker all-round performance when the sportier experience was requested. Jean-Marc Gales, Chief Executive Officer of Group Lotus plc, said, \"By introducing a paddle-shift, we have expanded the Exige product range to make it more accessible to customers worldwide. Now, customers who are more accustomed to two pedals and automatic transmissions can enjoy the unbelievable performance and handling of the Exige S without compromise.\" After exhaustive testing, it was anticipated that the Exige S Automatic would exceed the manual variant in performance.

Beautifully crafted, forged aluminum, manual shift paddles located behind the steering wheel cross-spokes, facilitated upshifts that took just 240 milliseconds, with rapid downshifts accompanied by a throttle-blip when in Sport mode. In both automatic and manual gearshift modes, the Exige S provided the driver with a very rapid driving experience. In Sport mode, throttle response was sharpened and the Lotus Dynamic Performance Management (DPM) increased the traction slip thresholds, allowing the driver even more vehicle control before an intervention was required.

Despite the luxury fittings and equipment expected of a modern supercar, Lotus remained true to its lightweight, dynamic remit. The new Evora 400 tipped the scales at just 1,395 kg (unladen), which amounted to a reduction of 48 lbs from the outgoing Evora S model. While still meeting legal pass-by and race track noise requirements, sonic changes were made to the post-catalyst exhaust system. It featured revised internals and a switch that could be driver activated, allowing the exhaust to flow more freely, reducing back pressure under higher engine loads and where conditions allowed. The by-product was a unique supercar soundtrack through the three-inch wider, central exiting exhaust pipe. A number of manual gearbox enhancements greatly improved shift quality, including a new clutch disc and a low inertia flywheel that ensured swift and tactile gear changes. For the automatic transmission option, a new shift strategy was developed, and for the manual version, a Torsen type limited slip differential (LSD) was now fitted to the rear axle as standard. This gave a more involved drive and better traction, helping to produce better lap times everywhere the car was tested.",

It joined the ranks of those rare cars that can reach 60 mph in less than three seconds and 100 mph in six seconds. To complement these figures, the 3-Eleven possessed a purity of the driving experience and the benchmark handling for which all Lotus cars are renowned, enabling a lap of the challenging Hethel circuit to be completed in 1 minute 19.5 seconds for the race specification version of the 3-Eleven. With lightweight carbon-composite bodywork as standard, the 3-Eleven had a dry weight of 890 kg and a maximum power of 460 bhp in the 'Race' version.

As expected for such a focused and extreme sports car, the 3-Eleven was capable of delivering high levels of aerodynamic downforce from the sculptured bodywork, rear wing, front splitter, and flat floor. The Road version produced 150 kg of downforce at 150 mph; the Race version, with its additional twin front canards mounted on both sides and its adjustable rear wing, produced a massive 215 kg of downforce.

Therefore, weight loss was the key focus, with 51kg taken out of the car, reducing the kerb weight to 1125kg.\n\nThe Exige Sport 350 retained the 3.5-litre, 345bhp Toyota-sourced supercharged V6 fitted to the Exige S. What did change was the manual six-speed gearbox. The gearbox's shift mechanism was thoroughly overhauled with a new mechanism designed to provide a tighter, more precise, and cleaner shift action, which some had felt was an issue on the standard.",

The gearbox’s shift mechanism was thoroughly overhauled with a new mechanism designed to provide a tighter, more precise, and cleaner shift action, which some had felt was an issue on the standard Exige. The Exige Sport 350 was the first Lotus to feature the new lightweight, exposed aluminium manual gear shift mechanism, something which soon became a welcome feature in every Elise and Exige. The mechanism’s new components were machined from cast aluminium and resulted in a 1.5kg saving. The six-speed automatic gearbox introduced earlier in 2015 was also available on the Sport 350.\n\nDespite no additional power from the V6 engine, the Sport 350 was a tenth quicker to 60mph, stopping the clock in 3.7 seconds. Top speed remained at 170mph, and it lapped the Hethel test track 2.5 seconds faster than the Exige S, setting a 1min29.8sec, the first production Lotus to get below 1min 30sec.\n\nAs you might expect, there was a backstory to the \"adding lightness\" aspect of the Sport 350.

As you might expect, there was a backstory to the \"adding lightness\" aspect of the Sport 350. The previous summer, Lotus took an Exige S apart and had students weigh the parts. They then got engineers, line-assembly staff, and suppliers to suggest ways to add the famous Lotus lightness, also improving the effectiveness and quality of component design. The exercise yielded over 120 ideas, many of which went into creating the Sport 350. Changes include a louvered composite engine cover to replace the previous glass item: -6.6 lbs, a new battery and mounting bracket: -7.7 lbs, lighter body panels: -26.5 lbs, removing some sound deadening: -6 lbs, replacing the handbrake: -0.57 lb, and deleting the sun visors and the passenger footrest: -2.6 lbs. The Exige was even homologated without air-conditioning, shaving 16.5 lbs, but to be honest, this would probably be added back as an option on most cars sold.

This achievement is particularly impressive because the time was set on optional Pirelli Trofeo tires, which are no longer road legal, whereas the Sport lapped on less sticky P-Zero Corsas. The tires were 205/45 R17s in the front and 265/35 R18s in the rear, with the latter stretched over half-inch wider rims. The Sport 350 program focused on weight loss, and with a lower mass, engineers could also focus on fine-tuning the chassis further. Camber, toe, and bump-steer were all adjusted; the toe angle was changed to allow a degree of pre-load in the tires, specifically a Pirelli P Zero Corsa or a Trofeo R for those track-focused, to eliminate the nervousness the Exige suffered on less than perfect surfaces. The steering rack was repositioned, and the rear wheels were widened by half an inch to 10 inches. Additionally, a new lightweight forged wheel was introduced, saving 5 kg of unsprung weight.",

A selection of beautifully finished carbon-fibre components come as standard, including a front splitter, rear wing, tailgate, and front access panel, all giving the car considerable kerb appeal. Limited to just 50 examples, the Elise 250 Special Edition was available in a choice of four colours, each a long-standing favourite over the last 50 years. Classic metallic blue, red, yellow, and white finishes were all complemented by ultra-light forged wheels in silver, or black as an option. An optional carbon-fibre hardtop roof panel was also available.\n\nThe same attention to detail continued inside, with the carbon-fibre sports seats finished in either dark blue or dark grey leather, and stitched with a choice of contrasting colours.

However, far from a stripped-out track special, the new model retained excellent road manners, remaining refined and composed on B-roads. Key to the cut in weight, by more than 70 kg, was the adoption of hand-made carbon-fiber components. Rather than just replacing existing parts with lighter versions, each was redesigned and enhanced in order to make the most of the composite’s properties. Covering the car from front to back, these included a front splitter, a revised front access panel, a roof section, a tailgate, rear quarter panels, and a rear diffuser. These were joined by race-derived carbon sports seats, which themselves saved 9 kg each. In addition to boosting acceleration, the car’s dry weight of just 1,270 kg (1,280 kg without the optional titanium exhaust or 1,291 kg for the automatic version) resulted in sharper and more intuitive handling.

        "content": "In 2017, following the successful introduction of the Lotus Evora 400 and Evora Sport 410 to global markets, Lotus unveiled its most powerful road-going model ever – the Evora GT430. The hand-crafted, carbon-fibre components endowed this fully homologated Evora with a level of precision engineering and design previously unseen from Hethel. This focused evolution of the Evora resulted in a landmark model for the Lotus. It is powered by a new development of the 3.5-litre V6 supercharged and charge-cooled engine, producing 430bhp at 7,000rpm and 440Nm (325lbft) of torque from 4,500rpm. The increase in torque is facilitated through the introduction of an air-to-liquid gearbox cooler as standard, a feature which made its debut on the recently launched North American Evora 400. As standard, the Evora GT430 also features a titanium exhaust, cutting 10kg from beyond the car’s rear axle and further amplifying the car’s aural presence. Also fitted as standard, the Evora GT430’s six-speed manual gearbox features a low inertia, single-mass flywheel, to help ensure swift changes, while a Torsen-type limited slip differential (LSD) gives better traction and faster exit speeds when cornering.",

Underpinned by the company's acknowledged eminence in lightweight engineering, and at a new benchmark weight of 1,258 kg (dry), the Evora GT430 was the most powerful and lightest Evora to have ever come out of the Hethel facility. Zero to 60 mph could be dispatched in just 3.7 seconds, and the car's top speed was 190 mph (305 kph). With new and specifically designed body panels, featuring exposed carbon weave sections, front and rear, the GT430 generated up to 250 kg of downforce through advanced aerodynamics. Benefitting from this significant hike in downforce, the Evora GT430 was a class apart from its competitors, although just 60 editions of this supreme Evora were to be hand built, making it a true collector's car.
