The General Safety Regulation includes, for example, rules on cybersecurity and new guidelines regarding driver drowsiness and distraction, such as distractions caused by the use of a smartphone while driving, intelligent speed assistance, reversing safely with the aid of cameras or sensors, data recording in case of an accident (black box), lane-keeping assistance, advanced emergency braking, and crash-test improved safety.",

In states with a full prohibition, vehicle manufacturers are required to either sell vehicles in those states through automobile dealers or similar entities licensed to sell vehicles, or not sell vehicles in those states. Some state laws also prohibit a vehicle manufacturer from directly servicing vehicles it manufactured. Regulations on Incentives: Almost all EU Member States have adopted various measures to stimulate demand for BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs. In addition, some member states of the European Union offer state-funded vehicle scrappage schemes that provide financial incentives for the replacement of old vehicles with new vehicles. There are also a number of government-funded research and development programs in the automotive industry within the European Union. Many of these programs focus on projects related to electric mobility and autonomous driving. In the UK, there are a number of tax benefits currently in place to stimulate demand for BEVs. For example, businesses using purely electric (i.e., not hybrid) company vehicles are entitled to 100% first-year capital allowances so that the full cost of the vehicle can be deducted from profits before tax.",

Under the EV Chargepoint Grant, people living in flats or rental accommodation are eligible for a grant that covers £350 or 75% of the cost to buy and install a chargepoint, whichever is the lower. Similarly, the Workplace Charging Scheme means that businesses can claim up to £350 or 75% per socket of the cost of up to 40 sockets, as a way of encouraging employees to make the switch to electric. Consumers used to be able to benefit from the Plug-in Car Grant (PICG), under which consumers could get a discount on the purchase price of plug-in cars; however, this scheme was ended in 2022. However, other types of vehicles may still be eligible for the grant, including wheelchair accessible vehicles, motorcycles and mopeds, vans, and taxis. For eligible vehicles, the plug-in grant enables the consumer to get a percentage discount on the upfront cost of the vehicle. There are likely to be tax benefits—for example, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) is calculated based on the size of the engine, year of first registration, and CO2 emissions—therefore most pure EVs are zero rated for tax purposes (i.e., tax-free).

Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators sets out a number of targets and other requirements which aim to increase the collection and recycling of waste batteries of all types, thereby providing further environmental protection and helping to prevent heavy metal pollution which can be caused by some batteries if not dealt with correctly. All European member states were given until September 26, 2008, to transpose the detail of the Directive into each member's local legislation. Costs associated with meeting the requirements of the Directive must be met by the producers of the batteries, and it must be free of charge for end users to place their waste batteries in the system that will ensure those batteries are recycled. The new EU Batteries Regulation is a proposal to repeal, replace, and significantly extend the scope of the existing EU Batteries Directive 2006/66/EC with a new, enhanced batteries law in the form of a harmonized EU-wide regulation. The draft new law contains full life-cycle mandatory provisions relating to a far wider range of batteries placed on the EU market than the current EU Batteries Directive, including for the first time lithium batteries, and generally all commercial and industrial batteries (as well as automotive and electric vehicle batteries).",

New duties that our entities may be required to adhere to include: Supply Chain Due Diligence, Durability/Right-to-Repair/Battery Conformity (there are proposed minimum values for electrochemical performance and durability of rechargeable industrial batteries), Labelling and Information Disclosure, and Enhanced Producer Responsibility for End-of-Life Batteries. The UK transposed EU Directive 2006/66/EC into national law in 2008 and 2009 under the Batteries and Accumulators (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2008 and the Waste Batteries and Accumulators Regulations 2009. This legislation makes it compulsory to collect and recycle batteries and accumulators, prevents batteries and accumulators from being incinerated or dumped in landfills, and restricts the substances used in batteries and accumulators.

We determined the estimated fair value of the trademark licenses based upon the relief from royalty method. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trademark licenses and discounted to present value, using forecasted revenue growth rate projections and a discount rate, respectively, that required significant judgment by management. We account for the compensation cost from share-based payment transactions with employees and non-employee service providers based on the grant-date fair value of the awards. The determination of the fair value is affected by the fair value of ordinary shares as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including the expected volatility, actual and projected share option exercise behavior, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends. The fair value of the ordinary shares is assessed using the income approach/discounted cash flow method, with a discount for lack of marketability, given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded at the time of grant.",
