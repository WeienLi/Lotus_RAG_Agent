With more time to work on the car in between his undergraduate lectures at London University, the car really began to take shape. The chassis was scraped clean, then checked, painted, and given boxed main members by welding a fourth side to the 'U' section, or 'top hat', chassis rails. Colin did most of the work but was helped by his car sales partner Colin Dare, Derek Wootton, and girlfriend Hazel Williams. The facilities were basic in the extreme, so the end product reflected the lack of power tools, with just one borrowed electric drill, and panel-beating expertise; any brazing had to be done by a local welder. The bodywork was very angular, created by using aluminium-bonded plywood panels, no doubt the result of experience gained through Colin's University College engineering course. The body was constructed of angular panels with contoured edges. The rear end was extended so that two passengers, more commonly known as trials ballast, could easily be accommodated, and it was topped off with a hinged lid. There were no doors, merely cut-outs.",

There were no doors, merely cut-outs in the body sides. The radiator surround was fashioned out of copper sheet and looked rather like a Rolls-Royce grille. Colin\u2019s learning curve throughout the whole process reflected his innate engineering aptitude and natural talent for innovation on the cheap. One example of this was a clever design to overcome the Austin\u2019s unfortunate habit of over-steering on corners as a result of the rear quarter-elliptic springs flattening as the body rolled. As his car was now going to be a trials car, he could not adopt the accepted solution to this problem, which was to replace the elliptic springs with flattened ones, because it reduced ground clearance to an unacceptable level. Instead, by swapping the axle casings from side to side and turning them upside down, he found a way to fit the flattened springs and still have adequate ground clearance. Problem-solving like this was to become the rule.",

It was not until after his Lotus Mk II was sold to Mike Lawson that Chapman decided to call his first car the Lotus Mark I (a reconstruction of which is pictured above), and his second the Mark II.

As on the Mark I, the main Austin Seven chassis members were boxed-in, but the cross-members were removed and replaced with tubes welded in position. This provided a lightweight but stiff frame. Colin used the Ford split front axle, fitted with bushes and suspended from the front of the Austin Seven A-frame. However, he did not want to use the heavy Ford rear axle, preferring the lighter Austin Seven unit which was easier to connect to the four-speed Austin Seven gearbox that he used in place of the three-speed Ford unit. Not satisfied that the standard axle ratios were high enough for his use, he famously devised a way to increase the ratio. He used the 42-tooth crown wheel from one axle type, mated to the 9-tooth pinion of the other type, then filled the differential not with oil but with Bluebell metal polish. It was run for 50 miles in this fashion, and then pulled apart. The bearings had been destroyed but the crown wheel and pinion now meshed perfectly.",

The solution was an angled 'snorkel' air intake, which, in ignorance of the de-siamesing, other 750MC competitors copied, thinking it was a clever Colin Chapman device for extracting more horsepower. A three-bearing engine was later used to solve the problem of bent connecting rods and oil-starved big end bearings. This engine had to be mounted on rubber mountings to stop the crankcase from twisting and the crankshaft breaking. This deprived the front of the chassis frame of rigidity, which, in turn, lowered cornering speed. The solution was bracing made with 14-gauge welded tubes that formed a cage-like triangulation around the engine.

The engine and gearbox were set well back in the chassis to keep as much weight as possible over the rear wheels, and the gaping hole between the engine and radiator was filled by another novel feature: two large Jerry cans filled with water. Unlike most trials cars, the Mark IV was a true dual-purpose car; it could be driven to the start of the event with the handling of a normal car. Once the Jerry cans were removed, the trial could be tackled with handling characteristics ideal for trials, but which made for tricky handling on normal roads.

As only the third FWA to be used in a sports-racing car, this was the first ever to appear in a Lotus. His car was registered as HUD 139 and first raced at Castle Combe on 28th August. Mark VIII production finished in early 1955 with the delivery of the seventh car to Tip Cunane, which became known as the 'White Lotus', a car that was more recently owned by Dutch Lotus enthusiast Olav Glasius.",

The production chassis was a further minor development of the Mark VI tubular frame, being shorter than the Mark VIII's (although on the same wheelbase) and, as modified for the enveloping bodywork, had lighter gauge tubing in some areas. In January of 1955, Colin Chapman gave up his job at British Aluminium and committed himself to working full-time at Lotus. One of the first tasks for the year was to address a demand for a more advanced Mark VIII, with a smaller engine. Low weight and advanced aerodynamics remained the goals, and Frank Costin's brief was to design a body that would fit inside the new transporter, so the Mark IX had to be a full two feet shorter. At the start of the season, the first two production cars used Alfin aluminium brake drums, but these were later replaced by an in-house design using cast Elektron drums with fins which fitted more tightly inside.",

In preparation for the 1955 season, Colin Chapman addressed customer demands for a Mark VIII with a larger engine by producing the Mark X. In fact, Colin was so enthusiastic about the project that this actually preceded the production development of the Mark IX. The 2-litre class was growing extremely popular, and the most successful cars (Cooper, Tojeiro, and Lister) used Bristol's 2-litre six-cylinder engine, a British-built version of the pre-war BMW 328 OHV engine that, with its triple Solex carburettors, could produce up to 125 bhp.

The new type number was Mark XI, but the Press soon latched on to the way \"Eleven\" rolled off the tongue. With the added complication that 11 could be confused for '2', Colin decided to dispense with the 'Mark' designation. The engine was mounted over the Girling dampers nearer the center of the car. The rack-and-pinion steering was extremely narrow to line up with the axle pivot axis, and specially cut steering arms lowered the track rods.\n\nIn profile, the Frank Costin-honed Eleven was the smoothest Lotus yet. While the scuttle was the same height as the Mark IX, the hood and tail were more steeply raked, and the tail fins were reduced in height. If a stabilizing effect was required for high-speed tracks, a head fairing could be added together with a metal tonneau cover, producing the \"single seat\" version.

A Coventry Climax engine had been fitted to the early pre-production car, and a handful of these were made to special order. In December 1958, a production version was offered with this engine. This was the legendary 'Super Seven', later also known as the Seven C. The Super Seven had a close-ratio Austin A30 four-speed gearbox and, with the 1098cc engine developing 75bhp, maximum speed was comfortably over 100mph: 0-60mph acceleration took only 9.2 seconds.

This engine produced 37bhp, which was a little more powerful than the Ford side-valve but was a lot more tuneable. It also formed the basis of the export Seven 'America', which used a 43bhp Austin-Healey Sprite A-Series engine. To satisfy American legislation, the 'America' did away with the non-swivelling front cycle wings in favor of sweeping wings\u2014a modification which was soon to become standard for domestic models, too.\n\nWith production of the Elite delayed, the Seven took on an unexpected mantle as Lotus' main road car effort, and about 60 cars were built during 1958.

This used a minimum of components, but its geometry was so sound that the same design was used for almost twenty years on his small single-seaters, and all versions of the Seven. The clever part of the design was to integrate the anti-roll bar with the top-link, thus forming an upper wishbone. Colin Chapman had used swing axle front suspension on all his cars to date, but in the back of his mind, he had a concern that the gyroscopic effects of the front wheels would cause unwanted steering effects as the speed of the cars increased. Even though at the end of 1956, when the Eleven S1 record breaker had lapped Monza at over 140 mph, neither driver was on record as complaining about the stability.\n\nThe 1957 Series 2 Eleven Sports racing car, with the new wishbone front suspension carried over from the Type 12, was designed to accept a range of engines, but this time the new Formula 2 twin-cam Coventry Climax FPF was an official factory option.

However, superstition reigned, and the 1957 car was given the name 'Eleven Series 2'. At this point, the 1956 car began to be known as the Series 1. Major changes for the Series 2, apart from the much lighter wishbone suspension, consisted of a larger diameter de Dion tube with more substantial rear hub castings, plus a more bulbous body in the area of both front and rear wheel arches.

There were essentially three members: the driveshaft, which located each wheel laterally, a single forward-facing radius arm, and the strut member (coil-spring and damper). These three converged into an aluminium casting containing two wheel bearings. The driveshaft was angled up by three degrees to provide slight negative camber.

The shape was designed with minimal frontal area, and the radiator was inclined back to reduce the height of the bonnet line. In order to keep unsprung weight down, a different type of wheel was chosen, namely bolt-on (rather than knock-on) magnesium alloy disc wheels. It was preferable to keep the thickness of the alloy as thin as possible, yet it also needed to be strong, so a web pattern was devised. The bending strength of the wheel varied as the folds became deeper towards the center of the hub and shallower towards the rims.

He quickly decided to minimize the use of steel and build what would become the world's first workable, large-scale production automotive glass-fibre monocoque.\n\nStructurally, the car was composed of three major mouldings and derived its strength from eight box sections. At the rear, a triangular box provided attachment points for the final drive and suspension; the propshaft tunnel, sills, and roof provided front-to-rear stressed sections.

Because the gearbox was rear-mounted, there was plenty of space for the pedals, which were wide-spaced.

It arrived just in time to be driven in practice for the 1959 BRSCC Boxing Day meeting at Brands Hatch. Although very different from the 1959 Lotus 16, the overall concept of the Type 18 was still typically Lotus. This included a spaceframe chassis, with the forward section fully triangulated and in itself a complete structure, which carried mountings for the front suspension, pedals, brake and clutch master cylinders, and steering rack. Forward of this braced section was a separate, lighter frame carrying the water and oil radiators, and oil tanks. The centre of the chassis was marked by a Lotus feature, a fabricated sheet and tube scuttle frame which eliminated the need for cross bracing. This formed a convenient and well-supported area to mount the instruments, steering column, gear lever, and other switchgear. The central part of the chassis, braced on three sides only but drawing torsional rigidity from the structures around it, connected the scuttle hoop to the engine bulkhead. The rear chassis had an easily removable Y-shaped diagonal section.",

The front suspension was by unequal length double wishbones, with the latest modifications of a separate anti-roll bar, and easily adjustable camber angle. There was insufficient height at the rear to install the familiar strut suspension, so Colin designed an entirely new 'double transverse link' arrangement, formed by the lower tubular links and the unsplined driveshafts. Parallel radius arms ran rearward from the engine bulkhead to the bottom and center of the upright.\n\nFollowing the lead set by Cooper, the obvious answer was to put the engine behind the driver, whose size would then dictate the frontal area of the car. The rear-engined layout had been well proven, and Colin felt sure he could improve on what he considered their rudimentary suspension designs. Colin always said he regarded the Type 18 as the first true Formula 1 car he had designed and built, his previous front-engined car.",

The increased drag coefficient of the flat sides was reasoned to be cancelled out by the reduction in frontal area. Brakes at both the front and rear were 9x1\u00be-inch outboard Lockheed systems fitted with finned aluminium Alfin drums to help give better cooling.\n\nFor Team Lotus, the 1960 season would prove to be incredibly successful.

The previous year's racing results had been poor, so Chapman decided that for 1960 a basic, simple, and easily maintained design was called for, rather than a technically superior but more complicated one. With simplicity in mind, the essentials were to minimize power losses, reduce frontal area, and keep the center of gravity as low as possible.\n\nThe Sixties saw Colin Chapman's persistent combination of dedication, design skill, and astute commercialism bring Lotus from the ranks of specialist constructor to a major British manufacturer.\n\n1960-69",

Bristol saw production of the Elite as the ideal exploitation of their extensive expertise in glass reinforced plastic manufacture, in both aesthetics and construction. The Bristol plant built the chassis body units from a new set of molds supplied by Lotus, and technicians worked hard to make the finish of the molds as flawless as possible, in the hope that the resulting panels would be free of surface irregularities.\n\nThe first of these revised Series 2 Elite bodyshells were delivered to Cheshunt in July 1960, and Bristol would continue to supply chassis body units until the Series 2 ceased production in the autumn of 1963. With their much improved methods of working, these new shells showed a genuine improvement over the old Maximar units until complacency set in and workers at the Bristol plant began to 'cut corners' quite literally, and the quality of production dipped dramatically. Bristol was embarrassed and immediately rectified the problems that were occurring and took much greater care in the troublesome differential and radius mounting area.

From then on, all shells produced would bear two small depressions on the underbody between the silencer recesses, which became known as 'double dimples' and would signify the new better built monocoque structures. The other major significant changes between the Series 1 and Series 2 versions of the Elite were, of course, in the suspension area. Born out of the experience gained from the race track as well as the 1960 demands of the customer, the Series 2 Elite received subtle yet effective revisions to both front and rear suspension. At the front, the dimensions of the springs were changed. Longer, softer springs, combined with new shock absorbers, gave a softer overall spring rate compared to the Series 1. A slightly changed lower wishbone, which had a more easily serviceable trunnion, was also adopted. For the rear end, fitting longer, softer springs and firmer dampers reduced the harshness of the ride but kept the race-track feel.",

With the rear end now bolted firmly through the bottom of the hub carrier, this new system with revised geometry further isolated chassis loads and virtually eliminated the rear wheel tracking problems of the earlier cars. Another new model in the Elite range arrived at the 1960 Motor Show, when a new Special Equipment model was introduced with uprated carburation and a tuned exhaust, producing 83 bhp.

In fact, it is said that little, if any, profit was made on the 243 cars produced. As early as late 1959, work began on designing a more cost-effective model. There were indeed several ways that this was achieved: chassis members were reduced in number; flooring to the engine bay and rear axle areas was omitted; steering geometry was simplified, including the use of a straight column; a very favourable deal for the supply of rear axles from the Standard 10 was struck with the manufacturers, which now meant the same natural stud centres to all wheels without the need for adapting hubs; cheaper 13-inch diameter Triumph Herald wheels were sourced from Standard Triumph; rear axle location was simplified by the use of an upper trailing arm to each end and a single lower 'A' bracket connected to the centre, under the differential, which also gave lateral support; the expensive aluminium nose and front and rear wings were replaced with coloured gel coat glassfibre parts, which removed the need for painting.

The meager production numbers had as much to do with the shortage of FPF engines as anything, and some of the later examples built were fitted with the larger 2.7-liter Climax FPF engine. In America, Dan Gurney was frequently entered by the Arciero brothers in their appropriate Italian red-liveried Type 19, and he impressed at Riverside in October 1961 by easily establishing a new lap record. Other cars may have been faster down the back straight, but nothing could remotely approach the Type 19 around the corners. Gurney commented, \"It was no particular driving feat.

In the USA, several Type 19s were re-engined using larger capacity American powerplants, and late in 1963, a one-off car called the 19B was constructed by the Lotus works in the UK. This, the final Type 19 built, was commissioned by John Klug, founder of Pacesetter Homes Racing, for Dan Gurney to drive. Fitted with a small-block Ford V8 engine, which necessitated the use of modified and strengthened suspension, the 19B was delivered in October of 1963 and campaigned as the Pacesetter Ford during 1963 and 1964, with little success however.\n\nWhile the Type 15 had been reasonably successful in sports car racing, it had never made Lotus any money.

The Type 21 was the new Lotus F1 car for 1961. Externally, it resembled the Type 20 (Formula Junior car), but under the skin there were several important differences. The troublesome Lotus gearbox (with its one tiny set of dog rings to pick up every gear) was abandoned in favour of a ZF gearbox, which the German company made exclusively for Team Lotus, in four and five-speed forms. Chapman had ordered it with the V8 engine in mind but it worked just as well with the four-cylinder engine.

The top wishbone was made of stainless steel and pivoted on a spindle which carried the entire front suspension load (a cross-brace was welded into the frame at an early stage to compensate). The inboard system alleviated a lot of drag and allowed for a lighter anti-roll bar.

His scheme was to space the sides of the backbone far enough apart for a driver to sit between them. It was all hatched at a lunchtime meeting with Mike Costin, when Chapman simply began sketching on a paper napkin. Straight after, he went home and drew up the general arrangement scheme of the first modern monocoque in Formula 1. He famously said afterwards: \u201cDespite people telling me ever since that there were monocoque racing cars in 1911 or whenever, the Type 25 was the first as far as I was concerned \u2013 I had never seen one before, and we didn\u2019t know if it would work.\u201d The monocoque chassis was made from 16swg aluminum sheet, with the side members being long boxes containing the flexible fuel tanks and acting as the lower body half.

With a monocoque tub, less space was wasted, and the Type 25 boasted the slimmest body ever seen in Grand Prix racing. No formal aerodynamic tests were carried out, but the simple principle of keeping the bodywork as tight as possible over the components minimized frontal area and reduced drag.

It is no overstatement to say that the Lotus Type 25 revolutionized Formula 1 design. It was a complete break from conventional thinking, advanced even for Colin Chapman, and its development was one of the best-kept secrets in motor racing. The major revolution was to abandon the traditional tubular spaceframe in favor of an aircraft-style monocoque, literally meaning 'single-shell'. The Lotus Type 25 featured twin lower wishbones, tubular stub axles, and the steering box was mounted high on the chassis, level with the top suspension arm. The rear suspension included lower wishbones with a single inboard mounting point, a single upper arm, twin radius rods, and an anti-roll bar. The driveshafts had inboard rubber universal joints.

Lotus was the only team to use the German ZF five-speed gearbox in 1962. In a concealed corner of the Team Lotus workshops at Cheshunt, the Type 25 was secretly prepared by Dick Scammell, Ted Woodley, Mike Costin, and Colin Chapman.

Despite a disappointing ninth place at Zandvoort, it was clearly more than competitive from the very start and quickly established its credentials as the fastest car in Formula 1. Jim Clark was the number one driver, accompanied by Trevor Taylor. In its first year, and in the hands of Jim Clark, it won the World Championship events at Belgium, Britain, United States, and Mexico, and also won non-championship F1 races at Oulton Park and at the Rand GP. Taylor had a poor year but did win the Natal GP. Three mechanical failures robbed Team Lotus of the constructors' title by just one point, and Clark came second overall to Graham Hill in the drivers' World Championship, who was racing for the BRM Owen Racing Organisation.\n\nIn 1963, changes to the car included fuel injection, lighter gauge monocoques, and nose cone side ducts. Lighter in weight and more reliable, the Type 25 had a phenomenal year. The Type 25, a milestone car, was known for its riveted monocoque structure, which, like an aircraft, made for greater rigidity with less weight.

As such, the Elan became more up-market. Overall, its design had less of the Elite's uncompromised feel and far more regard for production viability and costings. The simple, deep backbone chassis was made of 18swg steel with local 16swg stiffening, and weighed a mere 75lb. The central box section measured 11\u00bd inches by 6 inches and served as the propshaft tunnel while each end of the chassis forked out into narrower sections. Cross-members and turrets at the front cradled the engine, gearbox, steering, and suspension, and the rear housed the final drive and suspension. The suspension consisted of pressed steel wishbones with coil-spring/damper units at the front and, at the rear, a wide-based lower wishbone and coil-spring/damper unit set-up; the lower end of the strut fixed in a cast aluminum housing which contained the wheel bearings and hubs, as well as lugs for mounting the Girling disc brakes.

Steel strengthening for the door jambs made it sufficiently rigid to not have to rely totally on the chassis for its strength. Clean aerodynamics favoured a pop-up headlamp arrangement, which was worked by two vacuum cylinders. The front and rear bumpers were made of plastic and filled with polyurethane foam. With very little frontal area to work with, Colin Chapman again used his ingenious method for the placement of a number plate at the front.

The monocoque bodyshell had been a brilliant idea, but it was an ambitious move for such a small company. The Elite lost Lotus money, and there had to be a better way. Colin Chapman saw it in the backbone chassis, which would become a Lotus hallmark for years to come. The backbone chassis concept made its roadcar debut in the Type 26 Elan, a model which was crucial to the future of Lotus.\n\nIn 1962, Chapman wanted a twin overhead camshaft engine for the Elan and turned to Harry Mundy of The Autocar magazine. Mundy, formerly with BRM and Coventry Climax, agreed to develop a double overhead-cam cylinder head. Preliminary work was on the 3-bearing 109E block, until the Ford 116E 5-bearing block became available. The alloy heads were initially made by J.A. Prestwich, and then later on by Lotus itself.",

The head, pushrods, timing cover, and water pump of the original OHV engine were discarded, and Lotus fitted the Mundy-designed, aluminium DOHC head. However, the 100bhp engine was quickly superseded by the definitive 1558cc, 105bhp version, with twin-Weber carburettors.

Team Lotus cars were driven by Jim Clark and Jack Sears (the latter finished fourth overall and first in class, and shared victory in the N\u00fcrburgring Six-hours with Whitmore). 1966 saw Team Lotus campaign fuel-injected cars in Group 5 (seen above at Goodwood with Clark at the wheel), and win the Entrants' award in the British Saloon Car Championship. Production ceased in September 1966 as the Cheshunt factory closed, although it is believed that a few more cars may have been assembled at Ford's Dagenham plant.

Gurney had been impressed when he had seen the Type 25 in Formula 1 and thought a lightweight, mid-engined car could do well against the heavy and predominantly front-engined Indy Roadsters. A lightweight, low-powered car which could run on regular pump fuel (most ran on methanol) was viewed with skepticism, but tests showed that the slower speed on normal fuel was outweighed by better economy, meaning fewer time-consuming pit stops. Ford went for Lotus, and the Type 29 was born.\n\nIn general principle, the construction of the Type 29 monocoque followed that of the Formula 1 Type 25. It was wider, taller, and had a five-inch longer wheelbase, partly because of the regulations (which set a minimum wheelbase length of 96 inches) and partly because of the room needed to accommodate the Ford V8 engine. Lotus also cited the considerably taller stance of Gurney, compared to Clark, as another reason for the increased dimensions. The side members were 1\u00bc inches deeper and slightly wider than the 25's, and were increased in size to accommodate the following car stats:\n\nModel: Type 29\nName/Formula: Indycar\nYears of Production: 1963\nExamples Built: 3\nEngine Type: Ford Fairlane V8 Pushrod\nEngine Size/Power: 4195cc/370bhp\nLength/Width/Height: 150in/65in/30.5in\nWheelbase: 96in\nWeight: 1130lb/513kg",

In place of the usual fuel injection, Lotus preferred four DCOE 58 Weber carbs, and claimed the V8 Ford developed around 400 bhp at 7000 rpm.

Walker solved the bump steer problem by changing the height of the steering rack, and the handling was tightened up by replacing the rubber bushes with spherical bearings. As for the steel wheels, these were swapped for wider, center-lock, magnesium wheels. Another change was stiffer, shorter springs for a lower ride height, which in turn meant raising the height of the differential to compensate for the acute half-shaft angles.

Coventry Climax encountered endless delays and teething problems with its flat-16 and eventually announced that any further development would be reluctantly abandoned (its existing V8 was, in any case, proving to be the dominant power plant in F1). So Lotus had built a sleek one-off monocoque for an engine that would sadly never run.\n\nIn 1965, Lotus constructed the Type 39 as its new Formula 1 contender. The whole project centred around a brand new flat-16 engine being developed by Coventry Climax, the FWMW.

One of the very first was the so-called Lotus 7\u00bd, which was developed (unofficially) at Cheshunt by Lotus engineers Hugh Haskell and Don Gadd for the 1962 racing season. A Seven Series 1 chassis was strengthened and fitted with adjustable double wishbone front suspension, while at the rear a fully independent set-up was based around an Eleven differential (Elite in the case of the subsequent four cars built) with Lotus Type rear 20 hub assemblies. Fitted with a Cosworth-prepared Ford 105E engine, these advanced Sevens were extremely quick cars and raced with great success throughout 1962 and 1963. Colin Chapman even enjoyed one of his last competitive outings as a driver in the 7\u00bd when he competed in the 1962 Silverstone Six-Hour Relay race.\n\nFollowing this semi-official Seven was another development in the same vein, but it was given a proper Lotus Type number, 37. Although it was based around the Seven, it was always known as the Lotus Three-7. This project was conceived as a new-generation Clubmans racer for the 1965 season.

The Formula was based around open-wheeled two-seaters with a front-mounted Ford engine. Lotus 7s were a popular choice and highly competitive, but not as successful as the Arthur Mallock-designed Mallock U2. Perhaps this provided the necessary incentive to create a serious Lotus challenge in this formula, as Lotus was so dominant in just about every other formula in which it competed.

The choice of a new type number reflected the different perceived market for the new car. Since the S3 was launched initially in fixed-head form only, and throughout the production life of the Elan, the 36 type number was reserved exclusively for the fixed-head variant. This was to be a more comfortable, civilised Elan, equally capable of long-distance travel as well as tackling sharp corners in the usual Lotus fashion.\n\nThe major difference of the Series 3 was the fixed glass-fibre roof. This was quite unlike the removable hardtop available on drop-top Elans, with a different profile designed around new framed windows which sloped towards the rear (the S1 and S2 Elans had frameless windows). The screen was larger, too. Later in its production life, the fixed hardtop also incorporated ventilation outlet grilles on each side behind the side windows.

Ultimately, it too would suffer from a difficult and much maligned competition career, largely due to its somewhat rushed development at the end of the 1965 season, insufficient pre-race testing, as well as a general lack of resources at Cheshunt. The 'tuning fork' backbone chassis was stiffened, and the suspension was revised in an effort to improve upon the Type 30's notorious handling. The Type 40 would start the season at Austria with the old 289 cubic inch Ford V8 and ZF gearbox, but thereafter, finding the car seriously underpowered against the competition, Lotus fitted a larger 351-cubic inch (5754cc) Ford V8 engine. Developing around 410bhp, this was mated to the tough Hewland LG500 combined five-speed gearbox and final drive, in place of the earlier overstressed ZF unit.

In addition, weight was not usually a factor, as many cars were having to add ballast to get up to the minimum. For 1966, Lotus decided to revert to the tried and tested steel tubular spaceframe for its new Type 41. This car was built for Formula 3 applications, in addition to Formula Libre and US Formula B specifications. Original press releases stated that the Type 41 would also be produced for Formula 2 for 1966, but Lotus went on to produce the monocoque Type 44 instead. Australian John Joyce was given the design assignment, assisted by Dave Baldwin. It has been said that the chassis was a development of the 22/31 frame, but a side-by-side inspection shows that Joyce started with a clean sheet of paper.

Floors were also welded in for additional stiffness. In the usual Lotus fashion, water and oil were carried in the main chassis rails between the engine and radiators. A very clever system was devised to use the rear bulkhead as an oil overflow collector. Even the front oil tank had its overflow routed through a labyrinthine path using chassis tubes, all the way to the rear end.\n\nSuspension was fairly typical Lotus design, with one major difference: it was wider than normal. The A-arms were lengthened, producing a stance more reminiscent of an F1 car of the day. Type 33 six-spoke, six-bolt magnesium wheels were used in 7-inch and 9-inch widths.

Most customers in the first year opted for the Cosworth MAE engine, driving through a Hewland Mk6 4-speed gearbox. The gear lever was on the right-hand side and proved to be very difficult to operate due to the chassis reinforcing tube that interfered with the lever, as well as the confined driving position.

The season began with Ron Harris' Team Lotus running its old Type 35s, but at Barcelona, the Type 44 made its debut with Jim Clark at the wheel. Essentially, it was an evolution of the Type 35, with its monocoque hull modified to accept wider 41-type suspension. The nose and tail body sections were grafted on from the Type 41, giving the new Type 44 a wider, lower profile, which many regard as one of the most graceful of all the Lotus types. At the front end, Lotus kept the system of inboard coil-spring/damper units and upper rocking arms. But the track was much wider, achieved by lengthening the upper arms and the lower wishbones.

This meant designing a new tubular spaceframe aft of the truncated monocoque to mount the engine, and since the V8 was far longer than the BRM H16, the wheelbase was extended by no less than ten inches. Another compromise was the fuel tank capacity: since there were originally no rear chassis legs to carry extra fuel, there was a sizeable tank behind the driver. Surprisingly, the extra length seemed to have a beneficial effect on handling. The revised chassis was called the 42F.

The revised car was not only reliable but exceedingly quick, as was shown by the ten new circuit lap records set during the 1968 season.\n\nFor 1968, the car theoretically became a sports car (rather than a GT) by reason of its homologation as a Group 4 vehicle within Appendix J. The Gold Leaf Team Lotus drivers for 1968 were once again John Miles and Jackie Oliver, with occasional appearances by Trevor Taylor and Tim Schenken.

That lies in its engine, for the Type 49 was the first car to have the immortal Cosworth-Ford DFV V8 engine installed \u2013 the engine which would dominate Formula 1 for over a decade. Colin Chapman was instrumental in bringing the DFV engine to fruition. After a change in the Formula 1 regulations, he needed a new 3.0-litre engine for his forthcoming F1 car, and the BRM V8 and H16 engines used in 1966 were not altogether satisfactory. His long association with Cosworth \u2013 founding partners Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth had met at Lotus in 1957 \u2013 led him straight to their door. The trouble was raising the money to develop a new engine. Chapman managed to persuade Harley Copp, Ford of Britain\u2019s Vice-President, Engineering, to make an initial investment of \u00a3100,000, as well as providing some specialist help. It was to be one of the best investments by a major manufacturer in the history of motor sport.

Duckworth's first step was to design the FVA four-cylinder engine for Formula 2, as this would form the basis of a full Formula 1 V8 configuration engine. So the DFV engine was born: a compact 90-degree V8 with a stressed crankcase, which developed a quoted 400 bhp at 9,000 rpm.\n\nThe DFV evolved as a package with the Type 49 chassis, which was co-designed by Chapman and Maurice Philippe; as a result, the engine, gearbox, and chassis were beautifully integrated and as light as feasibly possible. Lotus said, 'a good deal less than a standard road-going Mini.' The engine acted as a chassis member, so that the monocoque became a simple nacelle, terminating immediately in front of the engine, which was carried on four mounting points.

The cast magnesium uprights incorporated the steering arm and yet allowed the brake disc to extend outside the wheel profile for better cooling. Steering was by rack-and-pinion, now mounted low down. At the rear, triangulated tubular frames provided upper suspension pick-up points on the cylinder heads, and another frame under the ZF 5DS12 gearbox provided the lower mounts. The transmission incorporated sliding-spline joints within the output shafts. The lightweight wheels were new, designed for the car.",

The new Formula Ford category was for single-seaters powered by a Ford Cortina GT pushrod engine and fitted with narrow 'road going' wheels and tyres. Lotus was in a good position to satisfy demand for such a racer, and it dusted off the old Type 22/31 spaceframe and developed it into the Type 51 specifically for Formula Ford. This did call for some chassis changes, however, specifically at the rear to make the Cortina engine fit. Formula Ford cars ran broadly standard 1.5-litre Cortina GT engines, with single twin-choke Weber carburation, which were lightly tuned to develop around 80-90 bhp. A 1600cc version of the Ford 'Kent' engine was soon adopted, with the title FF1600.\n\nOtherwise, the specification of the Type 51 was very familiar. The multi-tube spaceframe had a steel undertray, fabricated bulkhead and roll-over bar, and the suspension was by unequal-length wide-based front wishbones and, at the rear, twin radius arms, wishbones and top links, with outboard coil-spring/damper units and a non-adjustable anti-roll bar at both ends.

It featured unequal length wide-based wishbones with outboard coil-spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension, brakes, and gearbox all remained the same as on the 1966-67 versions of the car, with the wishbones, top links, and radius arms mounted on adjustable spherical bearings, outboard coil-spring/damper units, and an adjustable anti-roll bar. Officially titled the 41X in the 1968 Gold Leaf Team Lotus press releases, this car was intended as a test-bed for a new Formula 3 car for the 1969 season, which was to be designated the Type 55. This car was never actually built, though, and thus a permanent gap was left in the Lotus Type number sequence.\n\nThe 1968 Formula 1 season would be the one that spawned the \u2018high wing\u2019 concept of aerodynamics, and Team Lotus was quick in carrying this over to their lower formulae cars such as the 41X and the later Type 70.

However, the twin-cam engine in this format did not rev as freely as it had with the Webers, and after nine months of production, it reverted back to Webers for the UK market at least. Therefore, Webers made a welcome return with eight-port heads, although in true Lotus tradition, and in an attempt to use a cheaper item available on the market, Dellorto carburetors were still installed in some cars manufactured after this point. All federalized versions of the Elan S4 had the Zenith-Stromberg carburation with cross-over inlet pipes in the engine bay, as well as a single large earless wheel nut instead of three-eared knock-on type, side marker lights on the front and rear wings, and a door-mounted bullet rear view mirror. Many of these changes were brought about by the need to conform to the safety and emission laws being introduced primarily in the United States, including items such as the rocker-type switches on the dashboard, a collapsible steering column, and the need for larger rear light units.

This happened after Colin Chapman discovered that the Stromberg carburettor was significantly cheaper than the Weber units they had been using until now, as well as helping slightly with the extensive testing needed for emissions requirements in the USA. He directed engineers to make whatever alterations were necessary to accommodate the change, and the S4 went on sale complete with twin Stromberg carburettors and a distinctive bonnet bulge (just visible on the yellow car below). When it was officially launched at the 1968 London Motor Show, the Series 4 Elan also featured several changes that were prompted by new US Federal regulations. The new improved Elan Series 4, in both Type 36 fixed-head and Type 45 drop-head variations, was revealed to the public in March 1968.

Fitting the engine and transmission installation to the chassis meant that the rear suspension had to be revised; both the length and the position of the radius rods had to be altered, and with the engine around half a hundredweight heavier than the Ford Twin-cam unit which was standard on the Lotus 47, quite a lot of experimentation had to be carried out to achieve a satisfactory spring rate.

The chassis frame followed previous principles only in that construction was of the full monocoque type with separate inner diaphragms to form the fuel tank bays. The shape of the vehicle, however, departed from established practice as the result of extensive tests to determine the optimum wedge shape for an open-wheeled single-seater of this sort. Scaled-down models in the wind tunnel had demonstrated the importance of situating the air intakes properly to pick up cool air at high pressure. Also, the wedge shape addressed the importance of eliminating all high-speed lift after earlier Lotus research had shown that the lowest an Indycar ever sat was when it was not moving.\n\nFour-wheel-drive was not itself new to Indycar racing; in the '60s, the P104 Novi had run in the '500' with promise but without ever tasting victory, and the previous year, the Paxton-Turbocar of Parnelli Jones had actually led the race until a gearbox failure just ten miles from the finish.

Leonard, fighting back from second place, led once more and with fewer than a dozen laps left to run looked set to take the flag until, with just nine laps remaining, his turbine died. Pollard had retired too, his turbine also having died. In both cases, the fault was the same: failure of the fuel-pump drive. Ironically, while Lotus had requested to run with steel driveshafts in the pump, the units' manufacturer had fitted phosphor bronze items to the pumps on the other two cars, both of which had failed. Significantly, only Hill's car (on which the turbine had not failed) retained the steel originals.

At the rear, this would be in place of the traditional but comparatively heavy Lotus beam style of de Dion axle, seen on earlier cars such as the Eleven and Twelve. It had never been used at the front end before. Confusingly, the Type 58 was the first of the two cars to actually appear.

In Formula Two guise, the car was reported to handle beautifully and predictably, but it was by any standards too slow to be competitive. With a distinct lack of enthusiasm for Formula 2 within Team Lotus, the project was dropped and taken no further in this form. Instead, later in the year, and substantially revised, the solitary Type 58 chassis was completely rebuilt as a prototype, fully finished to Formula One specification, whereupon it emerged as the Type 57.

By 1968, Ford had brought out a new power unit for their European range of cars, and the faithful old 105E and 116E engines were now becoming difficult to source new, in any reasonable quantity. The new 225E crossflow engine came in two sizes, 1598cc and 1297cc, and was installed in the Seven in standard form with a single Weber 28/36 progressive downdraft carburettor. These units, producing 72bhp and 84bhp respectively, were fitted to the last of the production of Series 2 cars from the beginning of 1968.

This was then the first Seven to have an all-Ford drive train.\n\nThe many 'improvements' that came with the new car included: black carpet, upholstery, and trim instead of the traditional red; a fuel filler on the outside of the body instead of it being in the boot space; the luxury of a fuel gauge rather than the notched stick previously required; direction indicators as standard equipment; both speedometer and rev-counter in front of the driver rather than the former being directly in front of the passenger.\n\nWith the Ford axle came the wider 5\u00bd x 13-inch wheels.

Although Hill had won again at Monaco, the 49B had not lived up to the previous season's triumphs. With an upswept tail-cover that enclosed the repositioned oil tank and high-level oil cooler, the new 49B had a more pronounced Type 56-style wedge profile. A slightly longer wheelbase was achieved by raking the front suspension arms forwards, and a tougher rear suspension subframe which carried the new Hewland FG400 gearbox relieved the cylinder heads of their suspension load duties. Larger wheels and adjustable front aerofoils completed the package for that first race at Monaco, but the 49B would later evolve.\n\nIn early 1968, Colin Chapman had been working on a redesign of the Type 49, dubbed the 49B, but the loss of Jim Clark at Hockenheim delayed an intended early season launch of the new car until the Monaco Grand Prix in May. The car stats for the 49B are as follows: Model: Type 49B, Name/Formula: Formula 1, Years of Production: 1968-69, Examples Built: 12 (total Type 49), Engine Type: Ford Cosworth DFV, Engine Size/Power: 2995cc/415bhp, Length/Width/Height: 158.5in/76in/32in, Wheelbase: 97in, Weight: 1190lb/640kg.",

With the updated car, Graham Hill took 49B/R5 to his fourth (out of five) and probably easiest victory on the narrow streets of Monte Carlo. For 1970, the new 49C was further developed, with 13-inch wheels, new uprights, and revised steering. While Hill went to drive Rob Walker\u2019s Type 49C, Team Lotus fielded Rindt and John Miles in 49Cs until the Type 72 was ready. Rindt won a dramatic Monaco Grand Prix, the last of twelve Grand Prix wins for the Type 49. The Walker team soldiered on into 1970 with new recruit Graham Hill at the wheel of 49/R7 (now updated to 49C spec), while they waited for their Type 72 from Lotus. Hill, meantime, put in some creditable top six performances in the 49, especially considering his physical condition following his big accident in the 49B at the end of the previous season\u2019s US Grand Prix.",

He felt that offering \"Kit\" cars was not the image Lotus needed to move forward into a new era. Thus, in an attempt to push the car up-market (more luxurious and more appealing), all +2S cars would be factory built and assembled.

The rear wings, scuttle, and dashboard were integral mouldings, while the new-profile GRP wings and large tilt-forward bonnet were separate panels. All the GRP bodywork was built in-house by Lotus Cars, which kept costs down. Free-standing headlamps were supplemented by nose-mounted indicators, later moved to a more prominent position on the wings.\n\nMechanically, the S4 also took many new directions. The rear axle remained Ford Escort but was now located by Watts linkages and a single triangulated arm for lateral location. As before, there were coil/spring damper units front and rear, but the front suspension was based on the Lotus Europa. Only the very earliest S4 models had no anti-roll bar fitted. Brakes were carried over, but the steering reverted to Burman rack-and-pinion.\n\nThe engines offered in the S4 were the Ford 1600 (or more rarely 1300) units and the Lotus Twin-Cam (115bhp) and Holbay Big Valve Twin-Cam (125bhp). The Ford 1300 unit was an awkward fit, and indeed, one of the chassis tubes had to be cut away to get it in. A Ford Corsair gearbox was used.",

However, it is true that sales never remotely reached the 2000-per-year mark at which Warner had been aiming. Export markets did not respond with the expected enthusiasm, and the USA market was never exploited due to Federal emissions and safety laws. Mike Warner left Lotus Racing in April 1971 to be replaced by John Standen, whose task it was to wind down Lotus Racing. As a result, production of the Seven transferred across to the main Lotus Cars facility in late 1971 where it sat uncomfortably with the Elan.

Recognising that the revolutionary Type 49 had only a very limited lifespan remaining, Colin Chapman was keen to produce an entirely new kind of car with which Team Lotus could win its fourth Formula One World Championship \u2013 a feat which had never yet been accomplished. Thus, the construction of a 4WD car was undertaken, and drew heavily on the experiences learned through the Type 56B project, which had used an all-wheel-drive system.

With a Tecalemit-Jackson fuel-injection system and driving through a German ZF 5DS2 combined five-speed gearbox and final drive assembly, the power output at 8,000 rpm was quoted as 220 bhp. The car debuted at Brands Hatch for the 1969 BOAC 500, wearing the now well-established red, white, and gold livery of Gold Leaf Team Lotus. However, with John Miles and Brian Muir sharing the controls, minor problems kept the duo to thirteenth place overall, slightly disappointing even if it represented a class win for the 2.0-litre Prototypes. Thereafter, another car chassis was fabricated, and the two cars were raced in a number of both national and minor international fixtures, with Roy Pike replacing Miles when the latter was driving his four-wheel-drive Type 63 Formula One car. As such, the Type 62 notched up several wins \u2013 although often against fairly small fields \u2013 the car\u2019s most impressive appearances being a third place in the Tourist Trophy.",

With the effective exclusion of the gas turbine cars by air inlet restriction limits, Colin Chapman proposed a conventional rear-engined V8 layout but with the engine and gearbox reversed to accommodate 4-wheel drive, which would not be outlawed at Indy until 1970. Four-wheel-drive cars, however, were limited to maximum rim widths of ten inches at both front and rear \u2013 conventionally driven cars were allowed to run to fourteen. The resulting Type 64, known also as the STP-Oil Treatment Special, was shown to the press in late March 1969 before being flown out to the US for testing with Mario Andretti. Along with the regular Team Lotus Formula 1 drivers, Hill and Rindt, the press were told that Andretti would drive the new car at that year\u2019s Brickyard event.

There was a three-second lag on the turbo, though, and it was said that 500 horsepower came within a 500rpm powerband. On the Hethel test track, chief mechanic Arthur Birchall found it almost impossible to control the power. He reported a terrible vibration which was discovered to be caused by all four wheels spinning every time the power was applied.

Colin Chapman\u2019s marque was well known in the United States, mainly through racing exploits and particularly because of its Indianapolis successes.

He was succeeded by a variety of regional importers. Some of these managed to bring in a handful of Series 1 Europas, but in standard form they were definitely not to Federal-specification, requiring new headlamp bowls to raise them to the required minimum height. However, such sales did prove that there was a market for the Europa in the United States.

That year, with the maximum engine capacity raised to 2,000cc, Fittipaldi used a 1,930cc version of Cosworth\u2019s pricey but extremely potent BDA engine to win four races. One last footnote to the Type 69\u2019s history was provided by American Pete Lovely, who grafted the rear end from his Formula 1 Type 49 onto the back of 69-F2-5, competing with the resulting hybrid machine at both the 1971 Canadian and US Grand Prix events. He was the slowest qualifier in both events. Surely, the Type 69 is the only chassis type ever to compete in Formula 1, 2, 3, and Formula B as well as Formula Ford. The Type 69 certainly proved itself to be a uniquely versatile and successful performer, and probably the best overall single-seater performer for Lotus.",

Conceived by Colin Chapman and executed by Maurice Philippe, it proved to be perhaps the lightest car in Formula 1. The car's weight equalled the minimum permitted level of 530 kg, including fluids. Every aspect of the car evinced new and radical thinking. In appearance, its most visibly striking features were the side-mounted radiators, which allowed the car's designers to find an aerodynamically more efficient profile than previous cars. The gearbox from Hewland and the engine, Cosworth's 3-litre DFV, remained open to the elements. However, elsewhere, attention to aerodynamics was impeccable with flush rivets on external planes, a slim nose profile, and carefully contoured rear sections to give the best possible penetration and airflow. Throughout its five-year life, the car was most closely associated with sponsor John Player & Son, initially racing in red. Launched to the assembled press at Hethel on 6th April 1970, the Lotus Type 72, with no fewer than twenty Grand Prix victories to its name over the course of five years, established itself as one of the truly great Grand Prix cars.

The Type 72 made its debut at the 1970 Spanish Grand Prix but failed to find much success until Rindt took pole position in practice at Zandvoort. With Rindt going on to win the race itself, as well as the French, German, and British rounds in 72/R2 (Rindt also won the Monaco GP that year after reverting back to the trusty Type 49), he took the driver's title, with Team Lotus also taking the constructors' championship.

The Championship-clinching win for both the Drivers and the Constructors Titles at Monza was a memorable day for the whole team, so different from the same day two years earlier when it had been one of the darkest for Colin Chapman and Team Lotus. Although he scored no further points during the remaining two races of the season, Fittipaldi remained on a high, knowing he had become the youngest driver ever to take the title.\n\nFor 1973, Fittipaldi was joined by 'Superswede' Ronnie Peterson, and with the team switching to Goodyear tyres, they started the season in terrific form. Fittipaldi won both the Brazilian and Argentine rounds in a 72D, before the cars were revised yet again with new double-skinned lateral crash-pads and new undertrays. Further chassis modifications were made to comply with new deformable fuel-tank regulations. The car was: Model: 72D, Wins: Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Belgium, Britain, Austria, Italy, Second Place: Clermont-Ferrand, Third Place: Monaco.",

They incorporated many of the more successful features of the Type 72, including a full monocoque center section, side-mounted radiators, a complex sub-frame mounting for the front suspension, and the unitary engine/transmission/suspension assembly at the rear end. The aforementioned forward tubular sub-frame carried the rack and pinion steering and inboard brakes, as well as rising rate front suspension with fabricated double wishbones and inboard spring and damper units. The air-restricted 130bhp Novamotor-developed Lotus dohc engine and a Hewland Mark 8 gearbox formed a stressed chassis member, attached using a tubular framework, and with inboard rear brakes, the rear suspension was formed around single upper links, parallel twin lower links, twin radius arms with outboard coil-spring/damper assemblies.

Its origins derived from a proposed Formula 2 car planned for the 1971 season but which fell victim to the closure of Lotus Racing (Lotus Components) who built the customer race cars.

Eventually, and perhaps inevitably given the results obtained, factory interest in Formula 3 and its Type 73 dwindled to the point where Lotus withdrew.

At a time when all road tests were carried out with both a driver and passenger, the 0\u201360 mph time would have been well under 6 seconds minus the passenger, a phenomenal performance for the period.

The fabricated double wishbone front suspension operated inboard torsion bars and dampers, while at the rear, there was a more conventional coil spring/damper set up. The disc brakes were inboard at all four corners, and the side-mounted radiators for oil and water were fitted almost flush to the sides of the monocoque. Power came from the Lotus Type 906 alloy block, a twin overhead camshaft unit of 1,973cc and, some said, a derivation of its production engine, itself based on the cast iron General Motors/Vauxhall Victor unit that had already been extensively modified by Novamotor. By Formula 2 standards, it was a fairly large power pack, also a somewhat uncompetitive one, by the time several early reliability problems had been dealt with.

Indeed, supplied only as a finished car, it was priced at a comparatively high \u00a35,445 when customer cars finally went on sale in January of the following year.\n\nDesigner Oliver Winterbottom\u2019s fashionable and aerodynamic wedge-shaped lines, a complex confection of curves and straights, squared edges and smooth panels, gave the Elite an excellent coefficient of drag and a highly distinctive and modern appearance. By so doing, it effectively disguised the fact that, underneath at least, the Elite bore more than a passing resemblance to the Type 74 Europa.

That familiar Y-shaped Lotus steel backbone chassis, for example, carried a rear suspension layout not that dissimilar to its predecessor, while the front forks connected by a cross member. The Elite combined with a good ride, but by Lotus standards, this was a heavy car. Tipping the scales in the Autocar test at 2,598lb (well above the officially quoted weight), and nearly double the weight of the Type 74 Europa, it was close on 700lb heavier than the Elan Plus 2 and heavier even than many of its steel-bodied saloon contemporaries.

Aside from being highly aerodynamic, the new car was also the first of the breed to benefit from a new fibreglass moulding process which Colin Chapman had been developing for some while. By this time, the owner of two boat-building concerns, Moonraker and JCL Marine, Colin had been seeking a way of using technology to reduce the time spent in the labour-intensive process of hand-laying glass-fibre. His solution, well-suited to both his marine and motoring requirements, was Vacuum-Assisted Resin Injection (VARI), in which pre-cut glass-fibre matting is laid into moulds and the air expelled as the resin mix is injected under pressure. When it came to the Elite, this meant building the new car in two halves, top and bottom, hence its distinctive and practical lateral rubbing strip which also serves to hide the join between the two halves. Using this efficient system for both his boats and cars, Colin saw an opportunity to secure great savings in time and labour.

In appearance, it was a slightly angular, 'delta' shaped car, further distinguished by the rakish aesthetics of its high air collector and an unusual bi-plane rear wing.

In Spain, Peterson again led the race, but the cars were still far from sorted, and once more he retired with brake difficulties and another engine failure. This failure was brought on by overheating caused by starting the wet race with heavily taped radiators, which, when the rain stopped and the track dried, caused the water temperature to soar.

As such, it was something of an interim measure, built to 'hold the fort' during the 1976 season, while work continued apace on the forthcoming but still top-secret Type 78. \n\nBased on a particularly slim aluminium monocoque designed by Geoff Aldridge, the Type 77 was the work of a team assembled under Peter Warr and comprising Aldridge, Mike Cooke, and Martin Ogilvie. The challenge was to clear away memories of the underwhelming Type 76 and to devise a workable and competitive, if temporary, replacement for the increasingly geriatric Type 72. \n\nAt this time, the lengthy road circuits of the 1960s were being replaced by shorter, tighter circuits, a move which called for an entirely new approach to racing car design. Colin Chapman's solution was adjustable suspension, variable in both track and wheelbase as well as in several other key respects. The aim, naturally enough, was to reconcile the fact that on short, fast circuits, the car needed to be nimble and responsive.",

Aldridge, meanwhile, clothed the ensemble with the by now usual fibre-glass bodywork, shrouding a neat structural pyramid mounted above the driver's legs and tidy engine air intakes on either side of the cockpit (top right).\n\nAt this time, Ronnie Peterson was still with the team, but Lotus had some difficulty finding him a teammate until Mario Andretti agreed to drive for them in the first round of the Championship in Brazil.

Unquestionably one of the show's real stars, the new car was nevertheless painfully slow to develop, with that effort taking place over a two-year time span. The first pre-production prototype did not appear until late 1974, but the announcement of the production model itself was left until the following October. That made it almost three years since Giugiaro's exciting design had caught the public mood at Turin. The many well-publicized financial difficulties at Lotus conspired to slow the progress yet again, so that production of the Esprit did not start until well into 1976. However, unwelcome the record-breaking four-year gestation period was to prove, the mere fact that the car's design was still widely applauded when it finally went on sale says a lot for the enduring appeal of Giugiaro's original and futuristic 1972 design study.\n\nAt the Turin motor show in November 1972, Giorgetto Giugiaro's Ital Design studio had shown a stunning silver mid-engined concept car developed in close liaison with Lotus.

It appeared every bit as extraordinary as rival Bertone\u2019s earlier, yet still truly radical, mid-engined (Lancia) Stratos show car. Mechanically, there was little to surprise the seasoned Lotus-watcher as yet another Lotus production car appeared using the familiar steel backbone chassis, this time with the forked section at the back and with the cross-member up at the front. In naming the car, Lotus continued with its alliterative tradition of leading with the letter \u2018E\u2019 and, to many ears, acquitted themselves successfully after the earlier choice of the somewhat awkward moniker given to the \u00c9clat. The Esprit, while still a close-coupled two-seater, was intended from the start to be a larger, more usable machine than the pretty but occasionally claustrophobic Europa. Accordingly, the principal dimensions of the backbone chassis and cross-members were exaggerated in order to give the finished car a more spacious and roomy interior.

More humble were the origins of the front suspension, which differed little from the set-up employed in several more mundane saloon cars of the day: double wishbones and coil-spring/damper assemblies with an anti-roll bar and solid disc brakes.\n\nThe independent rear suspension was, of course, more complex, comprising fixed-length driveshafts which doubled as the upper transverse links, lower transverse links, box-section semi-trailing arms, and coil-spring/damper units with inboard discs.

In a detailed 27-page document, he set out his ideas and requirements before handing the project on to Tony Rudd, the hugely talented Rolls-Royce trained engineer who had served with such distinction at BRM. Inspiration for the car came from many sources, notable among them the inner wing section of the deHavilland Mosquito, and Rudd set out to devise a car which used its entire form to shape its aerodynamics instead of one which sought merely to compensate for an aerodynamically redundant shape by adding wings in the conventional manner. Maximum downforce with minimum drag became the team's new Holy Grail. The resulting monocoque was as slim as that fitted to the Type 77, but with wide panniers either side, a structural top panel above the driver's legs and, for the first time at Lotus, its construction made extensive use of Cellite, a sandwich of super-thin Dural panels enclosing a complex aluminum honeycomb.

The top speed claim remained at 138 mph, but the most noticeable driving change was apparently enhanced cross-wind stability, provided by the integrated front spoiler. The new Lotus-designed, 4-spoke Speedline wheels were a little wider (7-inch front and 7.5-inch rear) than the Series 1, and partly in an effort to alleviate the lack of space under the front bonnet and partly to save costs, a smaller 'get you home' spare wheel was adopted. Other external changes included the use of black chip-resistant paint on the front spoiler, sill, and valance, and the addition of protruding engine air intakes positioned just behind the rear quarter windows. On Series 1 cars, the only air coming into the engine compartment was drawn from underneath the car, and it was hoped that bringing in cleaner, fresher air would help with engine cooling, as well as clean running in wet conditions.",

This time, Colin and his team opted for huge bolt-on fibreglass side-pods, so that from above the square-cut machine formed a perfect rectangle. Each pod was configured to act as a giant venturi, with the air entering at the front and accelerating to exit at the rear, where skirts sealed the U-shaped section to maintain the integrity of the underbody low-pressure area.

And for Lotus, the car\u2019s arrival was timely too, as the earlier collapse of Jensen had left the company with a need to find another major customer for its 907-based range of engines.

The basic Talbot Sunbeam was something of an also-ran in the growing world of the hatchback, but the addition of a 2.2-litre version of the by now well-proven Lotus two-litre engine, mated to a five-speed ZF gearbox, seemed likely to move things in the right direction. A highly-modified version of the engine currently being fitted to the Lotus Elite, the 911\u2019s twin-overhead camshaft design aluminium alloy block, cylinder head, main bearing, and sump casing brought an exotic flavour to Talbot. Management hopes were evidently high that they could recreate something of the road-going magic and race-winning performance of the earlier Lotus Cortina.

The car was suspended from the ceiling of the Paradis Latin Nightclub in Paris before being slowly lowered onto the stage. That was in December 1979, two months before the Type 81s of Mario Andretti and Elio De Angelis sat together on the third row of the grid at the Argentine Grand Prix in January 1980, keen to dispel the bad luck which had dogged the team through most, if not all, of the previous season. The lack of results in the previous season had caused Martini to withdraw its sponsorship and prompted Colin to limit himself to the development of a car which was, all told, really only an improved version of its somewhat problematic predecessor, rather than another new and more radical contender. Principal funding for Team Lotus now came from David Thieme\u2019s Monaco-based Essex Petroleum, the cars running in the sponsor\u2019s striking blue, red, and chrome colors, but in other respects the new design seemed unlikely to make as big an impact on Formula 1 thinking as many of its forebears.",

With the transition from Essex limited edition to Lotus Turbo Esprit in April of 1981, the company slashed the price from \u00a321,000 to just \u00a316,917, relocated the radio-cassette unit to a more sensible slot and put the pricey air-conditioning back on to the ever-growing 'optional extras' list. By the summer of 1981, the Compomotive split-rim alloy wheels seen on the early Turbo cars were replaced by similar looking BBS one-piece cast wheels. With a recession looming, total Lotus sales in general remained poor for 1981 and 1982, but against this gloomy background, sales for the Turbo Esprit actually picked up sharply and the car quickly became not just the company\u2019s fastest car on the road but also its fastest-selling model, with 116 produced in 1981 \u2013 sales helped to no small degree by the car\u2019s starring role in that year\u2019s James Bond adventure, For Your Eyes Only.

In addition, the turbocharged cars of another team, Renault, were soon threatening to render uncompetitive the normally-aspirated Cosworth DFVs of teams like Lotus.\n\nAgainst this background, Colin abandoned attempts to develop the Type 80 to a point where it would be truly competitive. After FISA moved to ban sliding skirts, Lotus instead began a search for a magic ingredient to resolve the mutual incompatibility of suspension requirements between those parts of the car which affect its aerodynamics and those parts which insulate the driver from the road shocks. Thus was born the concept of two separate chassis with two separate suspension systems.

So it was that he decided to incorporate into the new Type 92 a computer-controlled 'active' suspension system that Team Lotus had had under development for so long. This system, while comparatively heavy with around 20 kilograms of hardware and requiring an additional 1.5 gallons of hydraulic fluid, was certainly clever. Designed and developed in partnership with Britain's Cranfield College of Aeronautics, it featured hydraulic rams on all four corners which were powered by a small centrally-located engine-driven pump. These rams effectively replaced the springs, anti-roll bars, and dampers and were controlled from a central processing unit (CPU) which received telemetric data from a battery of accelerometers as well as load sensors and transducers mounted on each ram. By analyzing the electronic input from these sensors, the CPU was able to build a 'picture' of the vehicle's movements and attitudes. Receiving signals back from the CPU, the suspension rams were then able to react almost instantaneously by extending or shortening the suspension travel to optimize the chassis attitude and control.",

Mansell just failed to make an all-Lotus front row but in the race itself finished third in front of his home crowd. It was the Lotus team\u2019s best result all year, and served as a bright finish for a European season which had started so badly.

Thought by contemporary commentators to clean up turbulence in this area (Lotus refused to confirm or deny this), and so reduce drag around the front wheels, their design was quickly copied by most of the rival teams. The cars ran an assortment of engines, using at various times throughout the season the EF4B (the low compression of which was excellent for high-boost qualifying sessions but carried with it the penalty of higher fuel consumption) and the latest EF15 power unit.

With a new driver and another new car, hopes were high as Team Lotus readied itself for the 1985 season. The driver was Nigel Mansell's replacement Ayrton Senna, a Brazilian who had attracted favourable comparisons with the likes of Clark and Stewart, and who already had a credible Formula 1 season under his belt with the underfinanced Toleman team.\n\n1985 Formula 1 Type 97T\n\nIn retrospect, at least, it is perhaps no surprise to learn that the young Senna emerged with such credit from the early rounds of the season.

Taking pole seven times in the first season, De Angelis managed only one, Senna's driving style was tough but unmatched when it came to achieving what was needed. His first GP win, a superb drive in appallingly wet conditions, came at Estoril for the Portuguese Grand Prix. A second win followed at Spa Francorchamps.

Pull-rods and wishbones were employed in the actual geometry, but in place of conventional coil-springs, the hydraulic actuators were the only true suspension medium.

Another brush with Mansell, this time a collision, took him out of contention at Spa, but once again he drove brilliantly at Monaco to take the flag. He repeated the feat at Detroit, taking first place and marking the 79th and, ultimately, final Grand Prix win for Team Lotus. Third in both the British and German rounds, and fourth in the French Grand Prix, Senna's car was modified in time for the Hungarian round with a lower, narrower cockpit and lower sidepods. Three more second places came at Imola, in Japan, and in Australia \u2013 although the last was later disallowed after scrutineers objected to the car's brake-cooling ducts. In addition, the Brazilian scooped fifth in Austria to come home third in the final World Drivers' Championship points standings, behind.",

Very few people seem to realize that this version of the Esprit was still being produced under the Type 85 designation, most assuming that all Esprit models were now coming from the factory with turbocharged engines and coded as the Type 82. In fact, the difference between the Esprit Turbo and the normally aspirated (n/a) base model was hard to spot for almost anybody except the real hard-core Lotus enthusiast. The new style car, code-named X180 by the factory, had been the work of a team of designers under the control of Lotus design director Colin Spooner and led by Peter Stevens, ably supported by Ken Sears. The fruits of their work were first seen when the new shape car was launched at the British Motor Show in October 1987, with delivery of the first cars going out to customers almost immediately. With the car being primarily a new bodyshell on top of an existing and well-proven chassis/engine combination, its development from start to finish had taken just 15 months, an incredibly short time to design what to the outside world seemed to be a new car.",

In a successful assault on wind noise, glazing updates modified the side-glass and added double seals to the window frames. A removable panel in the roof was supplied either in composite Nomex honeycomb or as a tinted glass sunroof.

Its annual sales rates were higher than those of the originals, partially because the same power-trains and substantially the same car could be sold in all markets. If Lotus had a first 'world car', the Esprit SE was that machine.\n\nKey components of the revised car were assembled around the 910S-coded version of the familiar 4-cylinder, 16-valve unit with its single Garrett TB03 turbocharger, complete with water cooling and integral wastegate adopted in previous editions. The big changes were the installation of Delco Electronics\u2019 GMP4 engine management that superseded the previous American emission specification and the more stringent European emission specification for markets like Switzerland. The latter gave 228 horsepower but was a low volume item sold only from September 1988 compared to the US Bosch fuel injection variants spanning 1985-1988.\n\nThe big bonus with GMP4 electronics and the new distributor-less twin coil ignition system was that the turbocharged twin-cam motor could release more reliable power on low-grade, 95 RON minimum, unleaded fuels.",

The second major alteration, which increased power output by 14 percent and torque by 17 percent (totalling 264bhp and 261lbft respectively \u2013 to a remarkable 121.5bhp per litre), was a turbocharger and intercooling system that Lotus dubbed 'Chargecooling.' Connecting the turbocharger compressor output to the plenum intake nozzle via a finned Behr water-to-air intercooler with its own plumbing (i.e., not shared with the motor), the chargecooler itself was compact. Its pure water coolant was driven by an ancillary Jabsco pump slotted into the redundant distributor drive, feeding a separate front radiator of considerable cooling capacity.\n\nEsprit Turbo SE, Type 82, did not just enhance steady state output from 225 to 264bhp at peak (6500 rpm), it also allowed Lotus to engineer a temporary (under 30 seconds) overboost system.

The January 1986 takeover of Lotus by General Motors effectively terminated any plans for a Toyota-engined sports car, but plans were still afoot for a successor to the Elan. With some \u00a335 million available to be invested in the project, this represented the largest such single investment in the company\u2019s 43-year history. The intention was to produce between 3,000 and 3,500 Elans a year, a substantial increase over normal Lotus levels and a stated desire to see the company producing some 4,500 combined units annually by the mid-1990s (a marked contrast to the 1981 total of just 345 cars). The first priority for Lotus design director Colin Spooner was finding a suitable powertrain, preferably one which was not yet in production rather than an established unit. It was to be Isuzu who came up with the goods, namely a new-generation 16-valve, 1.6-litre straight-four, suitable for front wheel-drive applications and with an excellent power-to-weight ratio. Front wheel drive was to be the car\u2019s \u2018big idea\u2019, a bid to appeal to a generation which had grown up with hot-hatchbacks, drivers keen to try something new but who would wish to stay with the sort of driving experience they understood.

The body's overall shape, with its unique 'cab forward' design, was the work of Peter Stevens, who successfully fended off rivals Giorgetto Giugiaro and GM's Chuck Jordan.\n\nFrom the start, Stevens' Elan was controversial.

The Isuzu turbo engine, which in all markets needed to be fitted with a catalyst, was left pretty much alone, but the rest of the car was distinctly different. Longer, heavier, and with a much altered chassis and suspension setup for the larger wheels, the Federal car was launched after considerable delay, primarily due to the difficulty in meeting the US crash performance standards. Engineer Jerry Boone spent almost a year working on it. Car stats are as follows: Model Type 100, Name/Formula Elan SE (Federal), Years of Production 1990-92, Examples Built 559, Engine Type Turbocharged Lotus Isuzu 4XE1-MT, Engine Size/Power 1588cc/160bhp, Length/Width/Height 152in/68.5in/49in, Wheelbase 88.5in, Weight 2445lb/1109kg.",

Engineer Jerry Boone spent almost a year working on revisions to the front of the chassis in order to achieve the necessary 'crushability' needed. Given the short front overhang and forward position of the engine, this was far more difficult than the team had anticipated. The steering column also had to be changed to accept the airbag system that was obligatory in the US. With larger 16-inch wheels and tires fitted, the steering setup required a new approach and gave a quite different feel, especially at the lower speeds, necessitated by US speed limits. \"A much tauter response and yet a lighter overall feel,\" was how Lotus ride and handling guru Roger Becker described it. \"The handling is even better balanced and total grip potential is higher in wet or dry conditions.\" The widely varied and distinctly different road surfaces in the US played a big part of the equation, and tire development was a big challenge.",

A lot of miles were covered across the US in testing during 1990. The exterior of the car was noticeably different from the European specification car, with its lengthened nose, slightly cleaner rear end with revised panel joints and integral wing, and larger wheels with smaller slots that filled the wheel arches far better. Many people felt that the US spec car was more attractive than its European counterpart. The interior came with leather seats and air-conditioning as standard, and although the two-tone stripe seat and door panel option was not available in the USA, some owners managed to find trim sets in the UK and have them retro-fitted.

        "content": "Though described by Frank Dernie as \"to a large extent an evolutionary progression on last year's car,\" the Camel Lotus Type 102 took at least one giant leap forward by switching from Judd V8 power to Lamborghini V12. This engine, mated to a new transverse-located gearbox, Dernie maintained, \"should give us more horsepower with reliability.\" Slightly longer but narrower than the Judd, the Lamborghini 80-degree V12 Tipo 3512 engine was also heavier and less fuel efficient. To some extent, this would be offset by its greater power output: 640bhp at 13,000rpm, and a revised gearbox using Lamborghini gears in a Lotus casing. Clearly, though, the challenge for Dernie and his team would be to accommodate the engine in such a way as to optimise the car's aerodynamic efficiency to such a point that the new combination would prove competitive. In a bid to keep the strong points of the Type 101 and delete the weaker ones, Dernie's solution was to locate the engine lower in the chassis, nestling neatly beneath the bodywork, and to further improve the vehicle's aerodynamics around the rear wing. With larger fuel tanks behind the driver extending across its entire width, the new car was also characterized by the following car stats:\n\nModel: Type 102\nName/Formula: Formula 1\nYears of Production: 1990\nExamples Built: 5\nEngine Type: Lamborghini 3512 V12\nEngine Size/Power: 3493cc/640bhp\nLength/Width/Height: 175in/84.5in/38.5in\nWheelbase: 116in\nWeight: 1102lb/500kg",

Despite the longer engine, the Type 102 increased in length by only 5 cm, largely thanks to the shortening of the distance between the engine and the gearbox output. To further offset the weight of the engine, every component on the car was scrutinized again to see how and where weight could be shaved off. The end result, according to Warwick, was that with a V12 engine, Lotus and its drivers were \"back in League One, racing together with the top teams and we intend to capitalize on it.\" His second, the Northern Irish Donnelly, was equally enthusiastic, clearly delighted to be competing in Formula 1: \"The car looks fantastic and I hope it isn't too long before we see it on the track.\"",

Competition-grade Monroe shock absorbers were installed, and later on, an electronic Lotus-GM ABS braking system was added.\n\nThe engine was blueprinted, using Lotus Carlton injectors, and in a test, one of the two race cars had the air-conditioning radiator ingeniously repurposed by being integrated into the chargecooler system. With a reprogrammed engine management system, the motor was capable of producing between 285 and 300bhp.",

Working with Aerodyne, an experienced specialist manufacturer of advanced composite components, January 1993 saw Lotus initiate a number of design studies for an all-new road-going time-trial version of the previous year's Type 108 that could accommodate road-going group sets. Work progressed rapidly, with the first wind tunnel tests of the new monocoque being completed in March of that year. By mid-June the factory was ready for the first test rides of the prototype Lotus Sport time-trial bicycle, to be designated Type 110. Thereafter, it was back into the wind tunnel to confirm these performance improvements, the end result being a sophisticated all-composite monocoque with an aerofoil cross section, formed using unidirectional and balanced-weave carbon-fibre plies in an epoxy resin.

The end result was a sophisticated all-composite monocoque with an aerofoil cross section, formed using unidirectional and balanced-weave carbon-fibre plies in an epoxy resin. While Boardman's pursuit bike had used mono-blade wheel location at the front, the new bike used a twin-blade wheel mounting but still with aerofoil cross-sections and constructed using a method identical to that employed for the main monocoque. The rear mounting featured 'wishbone'-shaped rear chainstays, integral with the monocoque with the wheel set into the rear of the monocoque for minimum drag. The bike competed for the first time in July 1993 on the Prologue of the Tour de France and was ridden by Erik Breukink of the Spanish ONCE team. It was equipped at the factory with a full set of Mavic components, thereby continuing the close co-operation between the two companies which had worked together on Boardman's Type 108 Olympic bike.\n\nTime-Trial Bike Type 110: The alteration, though, was to attach the smaller rear wing directly to the tailgate.

The Elise was quickly heralded as a new breed of supercar \u2013 small, high-tech, and simple, offering brilliant performance and handling for the enthusiastic driver, the hallmarks of many classic Lotus designs. Named after the granddaughter of the flamboyant Italian head of Bugatti Industries and Group Lotus chairman Romano Artioli, the all-new car featured a futuristic, yet practical and proven epoxy-bonded aluminum spaceframe chassis, clothed in a compact and highly distinctive body designed by a team headed up by Julian Thomson. The new Type 111 was intended from the start to be a particularly strong, ultra-light, very fast design and fun to drive \u2013 a new 'Seven for the 1990s'. The press and public certainly thought so, and it quickly racked up numerous awards for design and innovation, including Car of the Year (What Car?), Top Sports Car (BBC Top Gear Magazine), and Best Designed New Car (from a poll of Car Magazine readers).

The novel construction, its all-up dry weight of only 690 kg (1520 lb), and hence the car's extremely high power-to-weight ratio, showed the company moving in a new direction. By seeking to minimize weight rather than simply maximizing power, Lotus aimed to improve on existing sports cars' braking, handling, and steering responses, while simultaneously reducing overall fuel consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions to more acceptable levels. In 1996, working with Hydro Aluminium Automotive Structures (which had also assisted Renault with the development of its rival, the heavier Sport Spider), the Elise demonstrated an entirely new approach to vehicle architecture and brought to roadcar design a truly affordable 'spaceframe' style structure. This was made of epoxy-bonded sections of anodized aluminum extrusions, the whole being clothed in composite body panels (constructed using the traditional hand-lay system) styled by Hethel's in-house design team.",

A particularly fine-tuned independent suspension system, comprising upper and lower wishbones, co-axial coil-springs, and inverted monotube dampers, ensured that the new car could provide the handling to match. And, just as importantly, the Elise was to be affordable. Lotus was planning an initial production run of 700 new cars per year. The Elise turned around the public\u2019s perception of Lotus.

The development began on a road-going version of a turbocharged V8 Elise, and the team was trying to carry over as many components and systems as possible in order to reduce development time. The extruded aluminum chassis was the most substantial Elise component that would be used, although even then there were quite substantial changes.

Just over 200 V8 GTs were made in five years, and demand for the car reassured Lotus they had made some worthwhile changes over the original. The SE and GT differed mostly in overall weight as well as in standard equipment levels. The V8 GT was quoted at 1325 kg/2919 lb. \n\nLotus",

Yet Lotus themselves, in a text-only insert at the launch, quoted the GT as only having a 40 kg / 88 lb advantage.

Genuine carbon-fibre, rather than the common 'lookalikes', in the cockpit also assisted. This was applied to the instrument binnacle and centre vent covers, as well as also being used for the centre console and central switchgear surrounds. The cabin was also enhanced by a Momo steering wheel.

Introduced in January of 1999, the Elise 111S was the first model in the Elise range to be equipped with the MG/Rover Variable Valve Control (VVC) engine, a power source that Lotus had been hoping to use since the first Elise had been launched back in 1996. Always part of the Elise master plan, but subject to Rover\u2019s constraints of production and politics surrounding the MGF\u2019s premium engine, the VVC-powered evolution of the Elise was formally announced at the Geneva Show in the spring of 1999, with production having already begun in January that year. The launch price was \u00a326,590, some \u00a33,915 more than the starter price of \u00a322,675 for the Elise.\n\nThe 111S running gear showcased the Lotus-AP racing opposed piston calipers now working cross-drilled 282mm cast iron disc brakes, whilst the wheel and tyre specification was also enhanced.

The 160 was always destined for the showroom as well as the track, powered by a seriously redeveloped power unit that dated back to Rover\u2019s proposed one-make series for their 200 model in 1995, which was dropped after the BMW takeover of Rover. The Elise Sport 160 had a much simpler production life than the 190, serving as a hugely popular run-out horsepower special. Just 319 were made in two batches, and the specification was as flexible as that of any Elise, with some important options.

Compared to the Elise Sport racers, the biggest change that Russell Carr's design team had to face was improving road-going aerodynamic downforce over that of any other Elise. They also replaced racetrack impracticalities, adding bigger clearances for the new front splitter and abandoning the central driving position of the single-seat race-bred competitors. Most visibly, the front apron/splitter was raised to allow access over the humps that clutter modern streets and car park access areas. To continue to deliver effective downforce with a minimalist undertray/diffuser and still meet European safety regulations, the rear wing and its two pylons had to be rounded off.",

Lotus engineers managed the apparently impossible feat of stiffening up the chassis while simultaneously making the responses on the ragged edge a lot safer for an increased percentage of customers. Critical paths to such unlikely progress were the bespoke Bridgestone tyres and the installation of Bilstein high pressure damping instead of the Konis previously used. Forged steel hub-carriers replaced the original extruded aluminium ones and were accompanied by new wishbones, bushes, and mounting points for the aforementioned dampers. Both front and rear track was increased, as were the camber settings at the rear, while the chassis ride-height was lowered. The other tangible customer benefit of the S2 Elise was a far higher level of exterior finish brought about by the use of a new process for manufacturing the all-new composite body panels.

This was possibly due to the small rise in curb weight.

The same exhilarating abilities and reassuring consistency were applicable to the brakes, which were more durable than even the MMC units fitted to early Elises. The 135 model's breathtaking overtaking ability, a consequence of the accessible and flexible 2000 to 7000rpm power range, was well and truly in the motorcycle league. The fuel consumption was more like a motorcycle too, and independent test figures even averaged 42.4mpg, including test track mileage which recorded an indicated 135mph (true 129mph) while using 4500-6800rpm regularly for three of five tanks of fuel. Close to 40mpg was now a realistic figure for the Elise, and simple modifications to the cylinder head, air-intake, and air-box, as well as a new sports exhaust, transformed the showroom Elise into a quite formidable British A-road and B-road performer. The exhilarating performance of the new model was accompanied by some running changes that made everyday life with an Elise much easier.",

Any problems were then rectified by a specialist finishing crew wearing special protective clothing. The final testing stage before each of the last Esprits was shipped proved its considerable capabilities on the Lotus test track.\n\nThe Final Edition Esprit continued to use the double wishbone, coil-spring/telescopic damper set up at the front and the upper/lower transverse link with box-section radius arm configuration at the rear.

The first Lotus soapbox, designated as the Type 119, was entered in the open-topped 'roadster' class, rather than the more challenging closed-cockpit 'streamliner' class. Led by David Stacey, the team was granted access to the extensive facilities at Lotus\u2019 Hethel site, but it could only work outside working hours and within the regulations\u2019 budget. Support would eventually be required from over 150 Lotus employees, from metalwork fabricators to CAD modellers, from Lotus Design stylists to buyers. The team also brought in sponsors to supply hi-tech materials in return for logo placement on the vehicle.\n\nTowards the end of 2001, the Group Lotus board gave approval for a team of young engineers on the company\u2019s Graduate Scheme to enter the prestigious 'Goodwood Gravity Racing Club Soapbox Challenge', paving the way for what was to become an annual graduate project. To ensure a super smooth aerodynamic profile, the advanced carbon composite monocoque chassis was designed using the latest Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software, while ultra-lightweight components were used to minimize the overall weight. The soapbox's performance was impressive, with a top speed of 60 mph and an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. The Type 119 showcased not only the engineering prowess of the graduates but also the innovative spirit of Lotus.",

The Type 119's neatest trick, though, was its clever Active Mass Distribution (AMD) system that shifted lead ballast laterally to the side of the soapbox on the inside of the corner. This optimized the weight distribution to produce more grip, resulting in faster cornering. It was ingenious, and pilot Paul Adams claimed that at high speed he could gently steer the soapbox using only the AMD. After the nine-month program, glory eluded the Type 119 at Goodwood 2002. Over the two runs, Adams piloted the Type 119 to second in class and third overall behind BMW's Project Rolls Royce roadster and McLaren's streamliner. It was, however, a gallant debut in a field of 26 competitors. The following year, five newly employed graduates took up the Goodwood challenge with the Type 119B roadster.

James Setter led the team and believed victory would result from achieving the minimum possible aerodynamic and rolling resistance, so a brand new monocoque chassis design was penned. Many of the sponsors were retained for 2003's assault, and the majority of the materials and component solutions were identical. The team now had access to a wind tunnel and used it to refine the 119B's profile, while lightweight titanium steering components borrowed from Formula 1 helped improve the steering. Larger 26-inch Mavic wheels were expected to maximize the top speed, and enclosing them would further reduce drag. Top spec wheel hubs and bearings kept rolling resistance to an absolute minimum, while high-quality tires offered optimal levels of grip for the high-speed bends of the Goodwood hill.

Driver pairings included Barrie Wight and Gavan Kershaw in one car, and George MacKintosh and Sam Blogg in the other. The light weight and agility of the Lotus Sport Exige GT3, coupled with almost total reliability, ensured the team was competitive all season long. MacKintosh only missed out on the GT3 drivers' title by 5 points.",

The power unit was, as ever, mated to the regular Toyota C64 6-speed manual gearbox.\n\nThe enlarged roof duct inlet fed the chargecooler, and a body color splitter, side scoops, and rear wing differentiated the S from the 2004 standard Exige. There were also 'Exige S' decals on the rear transom, and a simple 'S' on the front quarter panels. With 121.4 bhp/litre, it was one of the most powerful production cars in the world for its engine size. Most importantly, it had full type approval for all the markets in which it was to be sold.

As all Elise drivers know, extricating yourself from an Elise/Exige with the roof in place can be difficult. Since Lotus envisioned a wider audience for the Europa S, the car was designed with both a lower sill and a slightly higher roof than the Elise. This gave an extra 55mm height in the door aperture, which may not have seemed a lot but certainly provided occupants with much improved access. Like the Elise, the Europa featured a lightweight extruded aluminum chassis which weighed only 150 lbs (68 kg), and with an overall weight of just under 2200 lbs, the car was only about 10 percent heavier than the current versions of the Elise.\n\nPower for the Europa came from the 197 bhp, 2.0-liter turbocharged Ecotec Z20LER engine sourced from the GM (Europe) inventory, which, when mated to the aluminum M32 gearbox from the Vauxhall Astra VXR, gave a 0-60 mph time of just under 5.5 seconds.",

The Lotus-designed, Magnuson-produced supercharger used a smaller Eaton rotor pack (an M45 unit) than that of the Exige S, and was married to the intake manifold plenum as part of a single-piece casting. Combined with the absence of an intercooler and its associated pipework, this integrated supercharger/intake assembly contributed to an 8kg reduction in engine weight compared with the Exige S. A further benefit of dispensing with the intercooler for the Elise SC application was the supercharger packaging viability for Elise and improved rear visibility when adopted into the Exige S, where vision from the rear view mirror was masked by the intercooler installation.

Bespoke performance enhancements were developed to offer a car with even greater levels of handling and acceleration capable of taming Europe\u2019s most challenging race circuits. In traditional Lotus style, weight saving was paramount. Weighing in at just 928kg, the power to weight ratio is an impressive 271bhp/tonne. Such a fantastic power to weight ratio alone, of course, does not make a superlative track car, so the Exige Cup 260 had a formidable list of standard equipment that included Lotus specific LTS compound Yokohama A048R tires, 4-piston AP Racing front brake calipers, adjustable dampers and anti-roll bar. The car could also be ordered as a Track Version for track use only. This variant came pre-fitted with an FIA approved 6-point roll cage, and 4-point harnesses, and had a wide range of motorsport specific options available.\n\nThe Lotus Sport Exige Cup 260 was one of the quickest cars around any given circuit, and key to this incredible performance was the aerodynamic package, which produced over 40kg of downforce.

A blend of avant-garde styling and ingenious engineering from Lotus Cars, the Evora shared the bonded aluminium technology pioneered on the Elise, which is now 14 years old. The Evora was built in three independent modules, comprising a central tub and sections for the front and rear. Although it shared its name with the ancient city of \u00c9vora, a World Heritage site about an hour and a half east of Lisbon, the name Evora was created by Lotus and derived from the words \"Evolution, Vogue, and Aura.\" The Evora's development was rapid by any standard. The initial sketches were penned in August 2006, and the first prototypes were being tested in early 2008. The disguises came off the prototypes after the unveiling in July 2008, and verification prototypes (VP) were being made in October. The first cars were scheduled for build in December of 2008. The first 16 production cars were earmarked as test mules to develop a federal version, with a view to producing the US car in October 2009.

Revealed to the public at the 2008 British Motor Show in London, the Evora had a sports-orientated suspension set-up, employing wishbones that were as light as those on the Elise but twice as stiff, and as a result, very expensive to develop. Despite the fact that the Evora was longer than the Elises, the intention was always that it should provide the same superb Lotus handling. The Elise was a familiar enough model to provide intelligible contrasts with the Evora. While both wheelbase and track on the Elise were significantly shorter than the Evora, and although the chassis, which weighed just 440lb, looked large, the Evora\u2019s width was kept down by cleverly reducing the sill width, without compromising its overall strength.\n\nThe new car was powered by a 276bhp, 3.5-litre Toyota-sourced V6, monitored by Lotus\u2019s own engine management system, driving through a manual six-speed Toyota gearbox.

Despite relatively modest power, the sub-3000 lb kerb weight helped it to achieve a top speed of 162 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 4.9 seconds. Designed in-house by the team at Lotus Design, the sleek exterior was wrapped tightly over the mechanicals underneath, for a low coefficient of drag (just 0.33). By careful management of airflow through the front of the car, balanced with a step-down roofline and an integrated rear wing, the design team found the aerodynamic downforce needed to enhance driving stability and cornering performance. Powerful bi-xenon headlamps were on the options list, as were parking sensors, a rear view camera, and folding mirrors. The more ergonomically focused Evora offered the most comfortable cabin that Lotus had ever created, and it was far easier to get in and out of than an Elise.

The renewable materials incorporated into the project provided natural, biodegradable, and engineering materials, illustrating Lotus' capability to utilize new, advanced materials, as well as the flexibility of their manufacturing facilities. Cleaner manufacturing processes were also sought, such as utilizing the latest water-based paint technology to reduce emissions of solvents from the paint shop.

        "content": "In August 2006, Lotus Engineering announced a bioethanol E85 version of the Exige. The research vehicle weighed just 930 kg and was called the Lotus Exige 265E. The \"265\" indicated the approximate horsepower of the vehicle, and the \"E\" indicated the environmentally favorable bioethanol E85 fuel (85% ethanol alcohol and 15% petrol) that powered the high-performing car. Key to this performance was a slightly modified version of the 2ZZ VVTL-i supercharged and intercooled engine as fitted to the standard Exige S. This gave performance figures that would thrash the majority of 'Super-Unleaded' performance cars: 0-60 mph in 3.88 seconds, 0-100 mph in 9.2 seconds, and a top speed of 158 mph. In fact, the Lotus Exige 265E was probably the world's quickest road-legal E85 bio-ethanol car. Ethanol has less stored energy per unit volume than gasoline, so the fuel economy is less. However, as E85 ethanol is 85 percent sourced from renewable bio matter, there is a net reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2). At the 2008 Geneva Show, Lotus showcased the even more powerful Exige 270E Tri-fuel. With similar performance figures to the 265E, but now with 270 bhp (at 8000 rpm), the 270E was capable of running on any mixture of gasoline, bioethanol, and methanol.",

The Tri-fuel Exige was part of Lotus' research to understand the complex combustion process involved in running on mixtures of alcohol fuels and gasoline, something which will become important if there is to be a successful transition from today's fuels to the sustainable, synthetic fuels of the future. Produced synthetically from CO2 and hydrogen, the use of Methanol (CH3OH), combined with emerging processes to recover atmospheric CO2, will ultimately provide the required carbon that can entirely balance the CO2 emissions resulting from the internal combustion of methanol. The result is that a car running on methanol, such as the Exige 270E, would be environmentally neutral. As well as being green, the great benefit of synthetic methanol is that it would use similar engines and fuel systems to those in current cars; and synthetic methanol can be stored, transported, and retailed in much the same way.",

Dany Bahar, the new Chief Executive Officer at Lotus, who had joined the company in September of 2009, summed it up beautifully when he said: \"You don't realize what you were missing from your driving experience until you get behind the wheel of the Evora S. It's the next level of Evora experience. It communicates with you better; the suspension setting has been fine-tuned for added power and control so it responds even more to direction. It's an instinctual car, the experience is pure. We were proud of the Evora, but we're even prouder of the Evora S. I feel like it does the true Lotus experience justice. The really great thing is that as we move forward, the standard Evora should also benefit from some of these developments.\" The Evora S came with a sport pack as standard.",

Interestingly, it was named to fit within the Lotus Type number sequence, despite the fact that the new team was not corporately linked to Lotus Cars. The unveiling was attended by some of the team's top executives, including the new technical director Mike Gascoyne, who had previously held the position with both the Toyota and Force India teams. Joining Gascoyne in the launch of the new car were Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen, who were given the distinction of piloting the first Lotus cars to race in Formula 1 for 16 years.\n\nDevelopment of the 2010 car started late due to the late acceptance of the team's entry. On September 14, 2009, the first four people started work in what was essentially a bare, empty factory in Hingham, Norfolk, just 10 miles from the Lotus Cars HQ at Hethel. When Kovalainen visited the Lotus Racing factory for the first time, people were still building the walls and floors. By November, they had a mock engine design, were working with Fondtech on aerodynamics, and soon announced they would be using engines supplied by Cosworth, along with a 7-speed, longitudinal, semi-automatic gearbox.",

The design was revealed to the press in October 2009, and as the team started a wind tunnel program in November, Gascoyne and Fernandes gave a joint interview saying they were \"certainly feeling the pressure of the famous name.\"\n\nFormula 1 Type 127: The late start by the team no doubt defined the design of the green and yellow Lotus T127 as super-conservative, with bulbous, flat-top sidepods and an overall short, wide configuration. As the team had little data to work from, they were cautious with the cooling and had to design aspects such as the brake ducts to the maximum size. With no refueling for 2010, brakes were certainly going to be at a premium and brake-wear a significant factor. Again, with very little data to work from, regarding the 90-degree V8 Cosworth's fuel consumption at the new higher 18,000 rpm, the engine was now facing new challenges.",

The cell was wide, which compromised the radiators and substantially affected the aerodynamics on the four chassis that would be built during the year.\n\nFront and rear suspension followed accepted Formula 1 practice and was by double-wishbone and pushrod operated inboard springs and rockers, moderated by Penske dampers. The forged magnesium BBS wheels were 13-inch diameter at both the front and rear and wore the regulation Bridgestone Potenza rubber. Right from the first round of the season in Bahrain, the double-diffuser didn't live up to expectations on the level of downforce the team was hoping for.

At first glance, the new GTE-spec Evora racecar may have seemed to have a similar appearance to the Evora GT4, which debuted in 2010, but as Kershaw explained, \"roughly 85 percent of the car is brand-new, with the production chassis remaining one of the only key components that's been carried over.\" With their Cosworth-tuned engines bored out from 3.5 to 4.0 litres and all-new bodywork as well as larger wheels and uprights, the Nicola Scimeca-designed Evora GTE was almost 120lb heavier than the GT4 model, yet was still considered a lightweight in the GTE racing category.

The livery was slightly different from the previous year's, with the new car featuring a black, gold, and red livery with more visible red on the sidepods, air intake, rear wing, and front wing compared to the 2012 car, where red only featured as Total oil and fuel branding. Very much a logical development of the previous year's car, the design team on the E21, again led by Martin Tolliday, produced another car that was easy on its tires and rode somewhat softly. The overall package was naturally very similar to the E20, with power for the E21 coming from the 2013 version of the 2.4-liter, 90-degree V8 Renault RS27 unit.

The major change in philosophy of the E21 in comparison to the E20 was in the sidepod/exhaust configuration. From the first concept, the E21 featured a Red Bull style, steeply ramped sidepod and lower inlet tunnel area. The 2013 system fed airflow from the bottom of the sidepod, keeping it separate from the exhaust flow used to blow the brake ducts and diffuser sides. From the Malaysia race onwards, this feature of the car's design received updates with an exhaust arrangement that brought it further forwards in the car, allowing a steeper ramp that did less to compromise the 'coke-bottle' profile of the lower rear bodywork. The team also continued to lead the way on the development of the front wing endplate area that helped guide air around the front tires.

Based on one of the most focused race cars that you can purchase, the Exige S, the V6 Cup was designed to be a dual-purpose street and track machine. For those individuals who desired to take their mid-engined street car to the track, Lotus released its no-frills, all-go racecar for the road: the Exige V6 Cup. The V6 Cup featured the same mid-mounted, transverse 3.5-litre, Harrop HTV 1320 supercharged V6 engine seen in the Exige S, which produced 346bhp at 7,000rpm. Power was delivered to the road through a six-speed close ratio gearbox, with the help of Lotus Dynamic Performance Management. This allowed for Touring, Sport, and Race settings on the engine and enabled the 2,470lb race car to accelerate from zero to 62mph in just 3.8 vision-blurring seconds. Equipped with fully adjustable double-wishbone suspension with anti-roll bars both front and rear, the V6 Cup rode on special 5-Y-spoke diamond cut 17 and 18-inch wheels, fitted with Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo tyres (205/45R17 front and 264/40R18 rear).",

These included the introduction of a complicated turbo and hybrid drivetrain as well as more subtle changes to the aero regulations that prompted the adoption of a distinctive new nose. First revealed to the public at the pre-season test in Bahrain on the 19th of February, just hours after it was announced that Lotus team principal Eric Boullier had stepped down, the new Lotus, dubbed E22, featured conventional front and rear suspension with, as in the previous two seasons, push-rod actuated dampers at the front and pull-rods at the rear.\n\nOver the past few years and in efforts to improve aero efficiency, Formula 1 designers had gradually developed raised noses but, for safety reasons, the new regulations from the FIA stipulated the use of a lower nose.

However, for safety reasons, the new regulations from the FIA stipulated the use of a lower nose. This resulted in some very unusual creations, of which the Lotus F1 two-fingered configuration was probably the most unusual. Sure to prove controversial, the car's new split-nose design was designed by Lotus to meet the new regulations dictating that the front wings were 150mm narrower. Although initial concerns over its legality were raised, it was deemed to meet the regulations. The chassis was designed by Nick Chester, Chris Cooney, Martin Tolliday, and Nicolas Hennel, with Renault again supplying the team's powertrain. The E22 was designed to use Renault's all-new, 1.6-litre, 24-valve V6 turbocharged engine, the Energy F1-2014. This would be the last car from the Enstone-based team to use Renault engines before a new one-year deal with fellow Daimler brand Mercedes came into force for 2015.

On 5 July 2014, Lotus F1 announced that the E23 car under development for the 2015 season would be switching to Mercedes power. This change ended the team\u2019s association with Renault, but drivers Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado remained with the team. The first images of the E23 were released to the press on January 26th, and the first car was fired up at the Lotus F1 Team base in Enstone in the evening of Saturday, 31st January. The car was immediately packed and left for pre-season testing at Jerez. Although other teams started running on 1 February, Lotus arrived late and managed to debut their car on track on 2 February, ahead of the team\u2019s expectations.\n\nOne of the most noticeable features of the E23 was the roll hoop duct arrangement. Alongside and slightly below the conventional inlet for combustion air, there were two extra ducts. Initially, the purpose of these was unclear to observers, but it soon became apparent that they fed air to a heat exchanger mounted toward the rear of the Mercedes power unit. A fourth, much smaller duct below the main inlet area sat directly behind the driver's helmet.\n\nThe overall car stats are as follows:\n- Model: Lotus E23\n- Name/Formula: Formula 1\n- Years of Production: 2015\n- Examples Built: 4\n- Engine Type: Mercedes PU106B Hybrid, V6 Turbo\n- Engine Size/Power: 1600cc/930bhp\n- Length-Width-Height: 5088mm/200.3in x 1800mm/70.8in x 950mm/37.4in\n- Wheelbase: 3000mm/118.11in\n- Weight: As per regulation",

The Exige S Automatic provided its driver with all-round engagement and excitement, reflecting the Lotus DNA of pure driving experience.

In both automatic and manual gearshift modes, the Exige S provided the driver with a very rapid driving experience. In Sport mode, throttle response was sharpened and the Lotus Dynamic Performance Management (DPM) increased the traction slip thresholds, allowing the driver even more vehicle control before an intervention was required.

Weighing just 866 kg, it was lightweight, efficient, and completely pure in its driving experience. Its handling and quickness in road holding remained, as ever, the envy of all its rivals. The Elise Sport 220 represented the perfect blend of power and dynamism in a more focused performance package. Weighing 914 kg, with a peak power of 217 bhp, it achieved 0-60 mph in just 4.2 seconds, with a top speed of 145 mph possible. However, it was once again in the area of vehicle dynamics that the Elise Sport 220 excelled, offering an even purer driving experience when compared to the previous Elise S model, due largely to further weight-saving, aided in part by a new lightweight sports battery.\n\nThe option of lightweight sports seats in leather, Alcantara, or classic tartan trim was a further sign of sports intentions. First introduced in 1976 on the Esprit S1, the tartan interior referenced a time when making a statement was everything, a concept still central to the Lotus design philosophy. Sport mode was standard fitment on both the Elise Sport and the Sport 220.",

The revised aluminium chassis incorporated a new interior, and the lightweight composite body had significant changes to both front and rear. Not only was the new Evora 400 faster than the previous model, it was also 42 kg lighter, achieved through careful and clever design and attention to detail. This weight reduction was even more impressive considering that the supercar had more power and a higher standard specification. The Evora 400's top speed is 186 mph, which places it in the upper segment of supercar performance expectations. Higher engine power, revised spring and damper settings, a limited slip differential, and a downforce figure of 70 lb at 150 mph helped reduce the benchmark lap time at the Lotus Test Track at Hethel by seven seconds to 1 minute and 32 seconds. This downforce was achieved by the Evora 400's flat-floor, lightweight composite rear diffuser, three-element rear wing, and clean airflow management.

The Evora 400, built for European markets, finally hit the production lines at Hethel in the early summer of 2015, and customer orders started being delivered in late August. North American markets had to wait until the start of 2016 to receive the Evora 400 as a 2017 MY release.\n\nThe Evora 400 was powered by the familiar 3.5-litre V6 engine but one with a new supercharger, water-to-air charge-cooler, and engine management systems. Its overall power output was increased by sixteen percent, from the 345bhp of the Evora S, to 400bhp. This power increase of 55bhp came from supercharger enhancements.

The by-product was a unique supercar soundtrack through the three-inch wider, central exiting exhaust pipe. A number of manual gearbox enhancements greatly improved shift quality, including a new clutch disc and a low inertia flywheel that ensured swift and tactile gear changes. For the automatic transmission option, a new shift strategy was developed, and for the manual version, a Torsen type limited slip differential (LSD) was now fitted to the rear axle as standard.

Delivered to the marque's now famous 'Lightweight Laboratory', it emerged with a range of features, including a Lithium-ion battery which slashed 10 kg off the weight, carbon-fiber seats, reducing the weight by 6 kg, and ultra-lightweight forged alloy wheels, saving a further 1.5 kg. Going on sale in all major markets (excluding North America) from April 2016, the Lotus Elise Cup 250 was now available for the first time as a roadster as standard, with a hard top available as an option. For those wanting to cut the car's weight still further, and so boost performance, a Carbon Aero Pack was also available, which cut an extra 10 kg, reducing the mass to just 921 kg. With the new car lapping the company's Hethel test track in 1 minute 34 seconds, the changes and engineering adaptations to the Elise Cup 250 had taken an impressive four seconds off the previous Elise Cup 220's best time and represented the fastest recorded lap time for a production Elise.\n\nThe new Elise Cup 250 benefitted from the continuous",

As the Exige had always been inherently 'right' and therefore had fewer areas that required attention, the Exige Sport 350 didn't undergo such a comprehensive update as the Evora had done to become 400. The initial plan had been to fit the Evora's 400bhp engine to the Exige, but in doing so it would have meant the engineers couldn't get the car below the 1200kg target weight set by Gales. Therefore, weight loss was the key focus, with 51kg taken out of the car, reducing the kerb weight to 1125kg.\n\nThe Exige Sport 350 retained the 3.5-litre, 345bhp Toyota-sourced supercharged V6 fitted to the Exige S. What did change was the manual six-speed gearbox. The gearbox's shift mechanism was thoroughly overhauled with a new mechanism designed to provide a tighter, more precise, and cleaner shift action, which some had felt was an issue on the standard.",

The mechanism\u2019s new components were machined from cast aluminium and resulted in a 1.5kg saving. The six-speed automatic gearbox introduced earlier in 2015 was also available on the Sport 350.\n\nDespite no additional power from the V6 engine, the Sport 350 was a tenth quicker to 60mph, stopping the clock in 3.7 seconds.

As you might expect, there was a backstory to the \"adding lightness\" aspect of the Sport 350. The previous summer, Lotus took an Exige S apart and had students weigh the parts. They then got engineers, line-assembly staff, and suppliers to suggest ways to add the famous Lotus lightness, also improving the effectiveness and quality of component design. The exercise yielded over 120 ideas, many of which went into creating the Sport 350. Changes include a louvered composite engine cover to replace the previous glass item: -6.6 lbs, a new battery and mounting bracket: -7.7 lbs, lighter body panels: -26.5 lbs, removing some sound deadening: -6 lbs, replacing the handbrake: -0.57 lb, and deleting the sun visors and the passenger footrest: -2.6 lbs. The Exige was even homologated without air-conditioning, shaving 16.5 lbs, but to be honest, this would probably be added back as an option on most cars sold.

The tires were 205/45 R17s in the front and 265/35 R18s in the rear, with the latter stretched over half-inch wider rims. The Sport 350 program focused on weight loss, and with a lower mass, engineers could also focus on fine-tuning the chassis further. Camber, toe, and bump-steer were all adjusted; the toe angle was changed to allow a degree of pre-load in the tires, specifically a Pirelli P Zero Corsa or a Trofeo R for those track-focused, to eliminate the nervousness the Exige suffered on less than perfect surfaces.

Based on the most extreme Exige to date, the Sport 350, the new special edition added a number of lightweight, performance-enhancing features, as well as unique paint and interior options as standard. Long regarded as the enthusiast's favorite, the new Lotus Exige 350 Special Edition took the model's benchmark handling and raw performance and added a sense of occasion. Packing a supercharged 345bhp, V6, 3.5-liter engine, and weighing 26kg less than the Exige Sport 350, the Lotus Exige 350 Special Edition accelerated to 60mph in just 3.7 seconds before reaching a top speed of 170mph. It was also capable of lapping the famous Hethel track in 1 minute 29.8 seconds. Complementing this class-leading performance, the car received a revised front access panel cover, as first seen on the Exige Cup 360, lightweight carbon-fiber sports seats, lightweight forged alloy wheels, and a Lithium-ion battery as standard to keep curb weight at a minimum. A choice of four colors helps the Lotus Exige 350 stand out.",

Refined from extensive testing and development, it was a design that proved its mettle by also powering the track-focused 3-Eleven and the recently revealed Evora Sport 410. The power boost came from a revised supercharger pulley, which increased charge pressure, an uprated fuel pump, a recalibrated ECU, and the introduction of a revised exhaust system \u2013 as used in the Evora 400 and Evora Sport 410. Allowing owners to enjoy the new Exige for longer between fuel stops, it also comes with an enlarged, 48-litre petrol tank.

Jean-Marc Gales, CEO of Group Lotus plc, said, \u201cDeveloping the Cup 380 has allowed us to indulge our motorsport ambitions on a car that can be used and enjoyed every single day. This is an Exige that\u2019s not just unbeatable point-to-point but also capable of winning highly competitive races.

At the heart of the new Exige Cup 380 lies a concept from the core of one of Lotus\u2019 founding principles. With an unrivaled lineage, the new thoroughbred Lotus Exige Cup 380 was endowed with race car sensibilities and road car manners. Honing the Exige Cup 380\u2019s high-speed abilities was paramount in its development, and the inclusion of new wind tunnel-developed aerodynamic elements allowed this road-going Exige to deliver up to 200 kg of aerodynamic downforce at a top speed of 175 mph. Located over the wheels, the front louvers equalize the pressure differential within the wheel arches, increasing downforce at high speed and under hard braking, while the cut-out sections behind the rear wheels work with the aero blades mounted either side of the race diffuser.

However, without the aerodynamic elements, at 1248kg (dry) the Evora GT430 Sport weighed 10kg less than the regular 430, bringing the power-to-weight ratio to 345bhp/tonne and the top speed to 196mph (315kph), making it the fastest Lotus production car to date. The Evora GT430 was differentiated from the later GT430 Sport through the inclusion of motorsport-derived aerodynamics provided by a carbon-fiber splitter, a large, profiled carbon wing, and louvers on top of each front wheel arch, which, together with wider wheels and tires, reduced pressure within the front wheel arches. From January 2018, automatic transmission was also to be available for both the Evora GT430 body configurations. With 10Nm more torque (450Nm), the Automatic version is even quicker.",

Key to the Cup's potency was the Exige's newly-developed powertrain. Based on the benchmark engine from the recently launched Evora GT430, it featured an Edelbrock supercharger and water-to-air charge cooler to generate more power through cooling the higher pressure charged intake air. Specifically developed for the Exige, the engine's calibration allowed for a redline of 7,000 rpm, helped in part by a new intake system and larger throttle body. To handle the extra power, a new oil cooler configuration and uprated clutch were required.

Combining the latest design philosophy with a car already acclaimed by both critics and customers, the new GT 410 Sport packed raw performance with Lotus\u2019 latest aerodynamic developments, to provide a first-class replacement for the Evora Sport 410 model. Employing key elements of the GT430\u2019s sculptured body style, including specifically designed new composite front and rear body panels, but without some of the high downforce elements, the new Evora GT410 Sport enjoyed a far subtler and sleeker silhouette. However, as with all Lotus sports cars, aerodynamic downforce is a requirement and this new GT-class coup\u00e9 generated up to 96 kg of downforce (50% more than the Evora Sport 410) making it the new benchmark when compared to similarly priced rivals. The Evora GT410 Sport was powered by a specially calibrated and tuned higher-output version of Lotus\u2019 supercharged, 3.5-litre 6-cylinder engine with integrated water-to-air charge cooler, producing 410 bhp at 7,000 rpm and 420 Nm of torque from 3,500 rpm.

The rear of the car now had two light clusters, rather than four, combining reversing and fog lights and adding visual width, to save 0.3 kg. The exposed aluminium gearshift mechanism saved 1 kg and brought quicker, more precise, more tactile gear changes. Offering 217 bhp and 250 Nm of torque, the 1.8-litre supercharged, chargecooled four-cylinder from Toyota was tuned to deliver stunning real-world performance and class-leading efficiency. 0-60 mph was now despatched in 4.2 seconds, thanks to a power-to-weight ratio of up to 257 bhp per ton. CO2 emissions were extremely low for the dramatic performance on offer at just 173 g/km. Stopping power was provided by AP Racing twin-piston calipers up front and Brembo single-piston calipers at the rear.

We have created something beautiful, something new, dramatic and unique.\" The Evija was set to be the most powerful and dynamically accomplished road car in the history of Lotus, and set a new standard for Lotus driving performance. It was the first all-electric British hypercar and the first Lotus with an electrified powertrain, as well as the first new model since Geely took control of Lotus in 2017.\n\nAt first known only by its Lotus Type number \u2013 Type 130 \u2013 the car was christened the Lotus Evija (pronounced 'E-vi-ya'). As a name, it is derived from variations of Eve, and means 'the first in existence' or 'the living one'. It is highly appropriate; Lotus has an unquestionable reputation for its pioneering approach in both automotive and motorsport. The Evija was the first Lotus road car to feature a one-piece carbon-fibre monocoque chassis.\n\nIn 2020, at an exclusive event at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London in July of 2019, Lotus shocked the assembled press and unveiled the Evija, the world's first all-electric, British-built hypercar.

In 2020, at an exclusive event at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London in July of 2019, Lotus shocked the assembled press and unveiled the Evija, the world\u2019s first all-electric, British-built hypercar. Phil Popham, Lotus Cars (UK) CEO, described it as a bold statement of intent from the British company, illustrative of its ambition under the stewardship of Geely. He added: \u201cEvija will re-establish Lotus as a leader in terms of engineering and design.\u201d\n\nEvija Type 130: The cabin, from the fully adjustable race-style seats to the multi-function steering wheel, was the very pinnacle of motorsport-inspired road car design and technology. At the heart of the Evija was an ultra-advanced all-electric powertrain, which had been developed with technical partner Williams Advanced Engineering, famed for success in motorsport, from Formula One to electrifying the first four seasons of Formula E. The battery pack was mid-mounted immediately behind the two seats and supplied energy directly to four powerful e-motors. This highly efficient system was the lightest, most energy-dense electric power package ever fitted to a road car. With a target weight of just 1,680 kg, the Evija was: \n\n- Powertrain: Ultra-advanced all-electric\n- Battery pack: Mid-mounted, supplies energy to four e-motors\n- System efficiency: Lightest, most energy-dense electric power package for a road car\n- Target weight: 1,680 kg",

This highly efficient system was the lightest, most energy-dense electric power package ever fitted to a road car. With a target weight of just 1,680 kg, the Evija was set to be the lightest pure electric hypercar ever to go into series production. Engineered for precise and sustained performance, the Evija had five driving modes \u2013 Range, City, Tour, Sport, and Track \u2013 and could rush from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in under three seconds and accelerate to a top speed of more than 200 mph (0-320 km/h).\n\nThe most striking element of the Lotus Evija was its exterior. From every angle, the full carbon-fibre bodywork appeared shrink-wrapped over the mechanical components. Unquestionably, the most dramatic element of the exterior was the Venturi tunnel that pierced each rear quarter. Inspired by Le Mans race cars, they optimized airflow by directing it through the bodyshell. This design concept, known as 'porosity', aided the delivery of high-energy airflow to the rear of the car. This, in turn, counteracted the low pressure behind the car to reduce drag. Furthermore, the Venturi effect inside the car stats: Battery Pack: mid-mounted, Energy Supply: direct to four e-motors, Target Weight: 1,680 kg, Acceleration: 0-62 mph in under 3 seconds, Top Speed: more than 200 mph.",

This, in turn, counteracted the low pressure behind the car to reduce drag. Furthermore, the Venturi effect inside the tunnels pulled air through the rear wheel arch louvres, maintaining air quality in the diffuser. When viewed from the rear of the car, each Milestone Car tunnel was edged with a red LED to create a striking ribbon-style light signature. The result was a stunning visual effect that was akin to the afterburners on a fighter jet, especially when seen at night. As an extra detail, an LED hidden within each tunnel illuminated its interior. The directional indicators were incorporated into the corners of the ribbon, while the reversing light was provided by the illuminated 'T' of the 'LOTUS' wordmark above the integrated charging flap. Another key feature of the Evija's sophisticated aerodynamic system was the bi-plane front splitter. It was another illustration of form and function working perfectly in tandem. Designed in three sections, the larger central area provided air to cool the battery pack \u2013 mid-mounted behind the car.",

When asked how the Evija's sophisticated aerodynamics compared to more regular sports cars, Richard Hill, the highly experienced senior engineer who has guided this critical element of the car's design, commented: \"It's like comparing a fighter jet to a child's kite.\" He further explained, \"It's about keeping the airflow low and flat at the front and guiding it through the body to emerge high at the rear. Put simply, it transforms the whole car into an inverted wing to produce that all-important dynamic downforce. Most cars have to punch a hole in the air to get through using brute force, but the Evija is unique because of its porosity. The car literally 'breathes' the air. The front acts like a mouth; it ingests the air, sucks every kilogram of value from it.

Gavan Kershaw, who also performed the duties of chief test and development driver, explained, \"Every Lotus is famed for its performance in ride and handling on challenging roads, surfaces, and through tight corners. This performance is borne from years of motorsport experience and testing at our test track in Hethel, something which delivers confidence, response, and feel to the customer.\" The reputation Lotus holds as a leader in intelligent engineering was preserved through the car's use of a lightweight carbon-composite body \u2013 optimized to ensure every gram serves a purpose.

The famous black and gold references the livery of the Lotus Type 72D, which Emerson Fittipaldi raced to five victories over the course of the 1972 Formula 1 season. The red, white and gold echoed the Type 49B that Graham Hill raced in 1968, while the blue, red and silver was inspired by the 1980 Essex Team Lotus Type 81 driven by Nigel Mansell, Elio de Angelis, and Mario Andretti. The fourth new Elise, finished in blue and white, was in tribute to the Lotus Type 18 design from 1960, which had been the first Lotus car to achieve a Formula 1 pole position and victory, courtesy of the late Sir Stirling Moss, at the Monaco Grand Prix 60 years previously.\n\nOfficially titled the Elise Classic Heritage Editions, all four cars offered an enhanced exterior.",

The 0-60mph sprint was now completed in 4.1 seconds thanks to a power-to-weight ratio of 260bhp per tonne. As ever, CO2 emissions were extremely low for the performance on offer at 177g/km. The car came with 10-spoke Anthracite lightweight forged alloy wheels as standard (6Jx16-inch front and 8Jx17-inch rear). They were 0.5kg lighter than the wheels on the Elise Sport 220 and shod with Yokohama V105 tyres (195/50 R16 both front and 225/45 R17 rear). Further weight savings were achievable through an extensive range of optional carbon-fibre panels, including sill covers and engine cover, plus a lightweight polycarbonate rear window. With all the lightweight options chosen, the mass of the Elise Sport 240 could be reduced further from 922kg to 898kg.\n\nThe Exige range was celebrated in its final year of production with three new models \u2013 the Exige Sport 390, Exige Sport 420, and Exige Cup 430.

The car\u2019s target maximum driving range was around 600km (373 miles) from a full charge, and the car also came with the ability to accept 22kW AC charging, which reduced plug-in time. The car\u2019s technology systems included the most advanced active aerodynamics package on any production SUV, as well as intelligent driving technologies such as the world\u2019s first deployable Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors. It was clear that the Eletre was making a simple statement \u2013 this was Lotus reinvented, the birth of a new icon into the Lotus stable.\n\nMatt Windle, Managing Director, Lotus Cars, commented, \"The Eletre is a bold and revolutionary new car, delivering on our commitment to move Lotus into completely new automotive segments. This is a momentous point in our history and a clear signal of our desire and ambition to transform our business.

The Eletre has the soul of a Lotus and the usability of an SUV. Alongside the Emira sports car, this is the perfect two-car garage from Lotus. The Eletre would be the first in a new range of Lotus premium lifestyle electric vehicles to be built at an all-new state-of-the-art production facility in Wuhan, China and set to go on sale across global markets in 2023. The car, the all-new, all-electric, Lotus Eletre was, without doubt, a striking and progressive addition to the Sports Performance Utility Vehicle segment. It took the core principles and Lotus DNA from more than 70 years of sports car design and engineering, evolving them into a desirable all-new lifestyle car for the next generation of Lotus customers. The name Eletre means 'coming to life' in the Hungarian language, an appropriate name as the Eletre marked the start of a new chapter in the history of Lotus \u2013 the first accessible EV and the first SUV.

The unique Lotus 'porous' exterior design meant that air flowed through the vehicle for improved aerodynamics, speed, range, and overall efficiency. The design was led by Ben Payne, and his team created a daring and dramatic new model with a cab-forward stance, long wheelbase, and very short overhangs front and rear. Extensive use of carbon-fibre and aluminium was specified for weight reduction throughout the vehicle.\n\nA signature element of the design is its 'porosity' \u2013 the aerodynamic principle of air flowing through the car as well as under, over, and around it. Porosity was at the heart of the Evija\u2019s design, was integral to the Emira, and provided clear inspiration for the Eletre. It was most obvious where air was channelled under the leading edge of the car, emerging through two exit vents in the bonnet above.

With the central section removed, weight is saved \u2013 a very Lotus concept \u2013 and allows the LIDAR sensor to be integrated at the rear of the optional fixed panoramic glass sunroof. Optimised for exceptional aerodynamics, the roof spoiler channelled airflow down the glass and into the active tailgate spoiler which was deployed automatically at speed. It had three distinct deployment angles, depending on the drive mode selected. Each door mirror was replaced by an Electric Reverse Mirror Display (ERMD), which houses three different cameras \u2013 one for the rear-view mirror, a second to help create a 360-degree view of the car from above to aid parking, and a third that's part of the intelligent driving technologies.
