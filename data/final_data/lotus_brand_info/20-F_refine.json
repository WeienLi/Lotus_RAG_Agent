In addition, this circular stipulates that qualified enterprises in certain pilot areas may use their capital income from registered capital, foreign debt, and overseas listing, for the purpose of domestic payments without providing authenticity certifications to the banks in advance for those domestic payments. Payments for transactions that take place in China must be made in Renminbi.

This regulation was in turn revised in 2019 by the adoption of EU Regulation 2019/2144, which includes, for example, rules on cybersecurity and new guidelines regarding driver drowsiness and distraction, such as distractions caused by the use of a smartphone while driving, intelligent speed assistance, reversing safely with the aid of cameras or sensors, data recording in case of an accident (black box), lane-keeping assistance, advanced emergency braking, and crash-test improved safety.\n\nIn the U.K., EU Regulation 661/2009 was adopted as retained EU law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and implemented by the Road Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2020. The changes made by EU Regulation 2019/2144 were not adopted in the U.K., as they were introduced after the U.K. had left the EU. Further legislation would be needed to transpose these into U.K. law; however, there are no current plans to do so.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act requires manufacturers of vehicles sold in the U.S. to certify that a vehicle meets all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, federal bumper standards, and federal anti-theft standards before that vehicle may be imported into or sold in the U.S. Those standards are issued and administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

In addition, the U.S. Departments of Energy and Transportation have indicated they may promulgate additional battery and EV safety and performance requirements, and we aim to comply with any such applicable standards if they are issued. Manufacturer Self-Certification. Federal law requires motor vehicle manufacturers to certify that a vehicle complies with all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, as well as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration bumper and theft prevention standards, before that vehicle is sold or offered for sale in the U.S. Federal law provides significant monetary penalties and other sanctions for vehicle manufacturers that certify as Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards-compliant vehicles that are found to fail to comply with one or more of those standards. These requirements apply equally to vehicles that are manufactured in the U.S. and vehicles that are imported for sale in the U.S. Other U.S. Department of Transportation/National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Requirements.",

The American Automobile Labeling Act also requires manufacturers of automobiles to state the percentage of our vehicle components that are manufactured in the U.S. and in other countries, and the location of final vehicle assembly. Each state may impose additional vehicle safety requirements with respect to vehicle equipment or components that are not regulated by a federal standard. Each state also has the authority to regulate the operation of vehicles within its boundaries, including prescribing licensing and registration requirements and traffic laws.

The GDPR obliges us, where applicable, to ensure adherence to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and purpose limitation, data minimization, data accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity and confidentiality. The GDPR also requires us to mitigate potential data breaches and to, unless the data breach leads to a low risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, report data breaches to the data protection supervisory authority within 72 hours. On March 9, 2021, the European Data Protection Board adopted Guidelines 01/2020 on processing personal data in the context of connected vehicles and mobility-related applications, which stated that much of the data that is generated by a connected vehicle relates to a natural person that is identified or identifiable and thus constitutes personal data under the GDPR.\n\nU.K.: The EU position is the same in the U.K., which adopted the GDPR as retained EU law at the end of the Brexit transition period.

The act establishes the rights of individuals to access, remove, restrict, and update their personal data and sets out core data protection principles. In the U.S., there is no overarching, generally applicable federal law that governs the collection, processing, storage, transmission, or use of personal data. More narrow and specific federal laws apply to the processing or other use or treatment of certain types of personal data, including information related to health, credit, telecommunications, and telemarketing, or to the processing or use of personal data by certain types of entities, such as financial institutions. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission may bring enforcement actions against companies that engage in processing of personal data in a manner that constitutes an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of states have enacted laws related to data privacy. Perhaps the most stringent and comprehensive of those state laws is the California Consumer Privacy Act, as expanded and supplemented by the California Privacy Rights Act, effective January 1, 2023.

The U.K.'s Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 provides a framework for ADAS regulations in the U.K. The Act allows for the creation of a new liability scheme for insurers in relation to automated vehicles, and the creation of regulations relating to electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including availability and reliability standards. In January 2022, the Law Commission published a report with recommendations for a new legal framework to support the safe deployment of automated vehicles. Its recommendations included writing the test for automated driving into law and introducing a second stage in the type approval process to authorize vehicles for use as automated driving on Great Britain roads. These recommendations have been laid before Parliament and are being considered as part of the government's broader plans to legislate on automated vehicles. In the U.S., currently, there are no mandatory federal standards specifying additional safety or performance requirements for AD/ADAS. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have issued voluntary guidance regarding the capabilities and performance of such systems, and there is a significant possibility that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may issue safety standards governing some ADAS in the next few years.",
