the Mark II was conceived as\na state-of-the-art trials car, which at the same time\nwould be usable on the road. As on the Mark I, 
the\nmain Austin Seven chassis members were boxed-in,\nbut the cross-members were removed and replaced\nwith tubes welded in position. 
This provided a\nlightweight but stiff frame.\nColin used the Ford split front axle, fitted with\nbushes and suspended from the front of 
the Austin\nSeven A-frame. However, he did not want to use the\nheavy Ford rear axle, preferring the lighter Austin\nSeven unit which was 
easier to connect to the four-\nspeed Austin Seven gearbox that he used in place\nof the three-speed Ford unit. Not satisfied that the
\nstandard axle ratios were high enough for his use, he\nfamously devised a way to increase the ratio. He used\nthe 42-tooth crown wheel 
from one axle type, mated\nto the 9-tooth pinion of the other type, then filled the\ndifferential not with oil but with Bluebell metal polish.
