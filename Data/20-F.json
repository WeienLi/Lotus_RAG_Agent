Our management team\nmay not successfully or efficiently manage the transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and\nreporting obligations under the federal securities laws and regulations and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. The need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the management\u2019s attention from\nimplementing its growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer\nliability insurance, and consequently we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These\nadditional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These\nfactors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of its board of directors, particularly to serve on\nour audit committee, and qualified executive officers. As a result of disclosure of information in this annual report and in filings required of a public company, our business and\nfinancial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and\nother third parties.",

Some required permits, certifications, or licenses are costly and difficult to obtain. Violations of applicable environmental, health, or safety laws and regulations may result in significant sanctions, including civil and\ncriminal fines, penalties orders to cease non-compliant operations or to conduct corrective actions, or suspension or revocation of\npermits, certificates, and licenses. The vehicles we intend to offer for sale in the U.S. must satisfy the applicable requirements of laws and regulations\nadministered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency on a federal level. Similarly, those vehicles must satisfy the emissions standards of the California Air Resource Board which is a major regulator on state\nlevel. Under the Clean Air Act, our vehicles are required to obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the Environmental Protection\nAgency and, for California and states that have adopted laws or regulations to utilize California\u2019s light-duty vehicle standards, a\nCalifornia Executive Order issued by the California Air Resource Board. A Certificate of Conformity and/or California Air Resource\nBoard Executive Order is required for each model year for vehicles sold in the U.S.",

        "content": "This regulatory process is designed to ensure that all\nvehicles comply with applicable emission standards for both criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, and\ngreenhouse house gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. This process also includes labelling requirements to provide consumer\ninformation such as miles per gallon or gas-equivalent ratings and maximum range on a single charge. We expect our all-electric, battery-powered vehicles to generate regulatory compliance credits that can be monetized through\nsale to other OEMs. Under California\u2019s Low-Emission Vehicle Program, and equivalent requirements that apply in the states that have\nadopted California\u2019s standards, OEMs are required to produce an increasing percentage of BEVs, fuel cell electric vehicles, or plug-in\nhybrid electric vehicles. The zero-emission vehicle program of the California Air Resource Board requires OEMs to produce a certain\nnumber BEVs, fuel cell electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles each year, based on the total number of cars sold in California\nor the other states that have adopted the zero-emission vehicle program, ranging from 4.5% in 2018 to 22% by 2025. Moreover,\nCalifornia\u2019s zero-emission vehicle program requires 100% of all new passenger car and light-duty truck sales to qualify as zero-emission\nvehicles by 2035. As a developer of zero-emission vehicles, we may earn zero-emission vehicle credits on each electric vehicle sold in\nCalifornia or other participating states, which may be sold to other OEMs without the need to offset any greenhouse house gases or other\npollutant emitting ICE vehicles.",

        "content": "In addition to state-level credits, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nrequire all OEMs to meet minimum greenhouse house gas emission and corporate average fuel economy standards applicable to light-\nduty vehicles. These federal regulations require that manufacturers of light-duty vehicles meet minimum threshold standards for\ngreenhouse house gas emissions and fuel economy based on a vehicle\u2019s footprint or overall dimensions. We will also benefit from these\nregulations as a developer of zero-emission vehicles because each electric vehicle will generate greenhouse house gas and corporate\naverage fuel economy credits which can be sold to other manufacturers. In December 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency\nfinalized revised greenhouse house gas standards for model year 2023 \u2013 2026 light-duty vehicles. In May 2022, the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration finalized revised corporate average fuel economy standards for model year 2024 \u2013 2026 light-duty\nvehicles. These standards require fleetwide increases in fuel economy and decreases in greenhouse house gas emissions from ICE\nequipped vehicles produced by all manufacturers. In May 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a new suite of greenhouse house gas and criteria pollutant\nemission standards for model year 2027 \u2013 2032 light-duty vehicles. In the proposed regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency\nestimates the revised emission standards would require BEVs to account for 60% of total light-duty vehicle sales by 2030 and 67% of\ntotal sales by 2032.",

These regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. If the more stringent corporate average\nfuel economy and greenhouse house gas emission standards are finalized, we may be positioned to monetize the credits we may earn for\nselling zero-emission vehicles in the U.S. Regulations on Recall Activities\nManufacturers of vehicles sold in the U.S. must recall such vehicles if they are found to have a safety defect or fail to comply\nwith an applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The primary recall obligations are to provide notice to owners of all affected\nvehicles, and to offer a remedy, free of charge, to all affected vehicle owners. 120",
