With 250 bhp from the supercharged engine, designed to make the most of the Elise's exceptionally stiff extruded and bonded aluminium chassis, it endowed the Cup 260 with phenomenal straight-line speed, agile handling, and, with the significant downforce available and the wider, road-legal motorsport tyres, harder and faster cornering. These elements combined to deliver a lap of the Hethel track in just 1 minute 32 seconds, 2.5 seconds faster than the Elise Cup 250. \n\nWorking with the redesigned lightweight front clam panel, with wider apertures, carbon front splitter, and the rear diffuser, these generated up to 180 kg of downforce at the car's top speed of 151 mph.

Building on the production Elise Cup 250 released earlier in the year, and drawing heavily on the development of the motorsport Elise Race 250, the Elise Cup 260's performance was formed through a first-class combination of intelligent engineering and advanced aerodynamics, as well as a boost in engine performance. Not only the lightest ever Elise Cup, it was also the fastest at speed – with the car's design and aero configuration generating up to 180 kg of downforce at 151 mph. Key to this exceptionally high level of downforce were aero lessons learnt from the latest Lotus models, including the Evora GT 430. The new louvred front wheel-arch vents, lightweight carbon-fibre front splitter, and wide high-mounted rear wing (developed from the Lotus 3-Eleven), were part of a no-holds-barred approach.

The Evora GT410 Sport was powered by a specially calibrated and tuned higher-output version of Lotus’ supercharged, 3.5-litre 6-cylinder engine with integrated water-to-air charge cooler, producing 410 bhp at 7,000 rpm and 420 Nm of torque from 3,500 rpm.

The development of the new Evora GT410 Sport gave Lotus the chance to optimize mass, resulting in an unladen weight of 1,297kg and a lightest possible dry weight of 1,256kg. This included all the optional titanium exhaust, saving 10kg, and the Lotus-tuned Öhlins TTX aluminum two-way adjustable dampers, saving 13kg—a total saving of 98kg when compared to the Evora 400 benchmark, and up to 28kg less than the already featherweight Evora Sport 410. Lotus’ newly defined GT-class sports car certainly captured the essence of the company’s headline model. The top-down evolution introduced a new front and rear aesthetic, first seen on the GT430.

As a result, the car's design combined considerable physical presence with natural aerodynamic ability. The revised front panel featured two enlarged carbon-fibre ducts, with integrated air blades, to efficiently move air around the front wheels, reducing turbulence and decreasing drag. Additional downforce was created by the combination of the deep front splitter and the new motorsport-derived rear diffuser, mounted beneath the new style metal mesh grille which gives a cleaner finish. Sculptured carbon-fibre ducts behind each rear wheel vented high-pressure air as quickly as possible from the rear wheel arches, balancing downforce. Cumulatively, this all worked to boost downforce to 96kg at 190mph, a sizable jump of fifty percent over the outgoing Evora Sport 410, and a massive three times that of the Evora 400 with an improved drag coefficient.

With 410bhp and 420Nm, it meets an unladen weight of just 1110kg for an exhilarating 369bhp per ton. Capable of 0-60mph in just 3.3 seconds, the coupé could record fierce in-gear acceleration all the way to a top speed of 174mph. The advanced aerodynamics were carefully balanced, generating 70kg of downforce at the rear and 45kg up front for a total of 115kg at 174mph. The redesigned lightweight front clam panel incorporated wider grilles, a front splitter, and carbon-fibre air curtains to minimize drag, which allowed the Sport 410 to match the top speed of the aforementioned more powerful Exige Cup 430. As with every Exige, however, corner speed was more important and even more impressive. Conveying an extraordinary level of tactility and precision, in both coupé or roadster forms, the Exige Sport 410 demonstrated that race car responses could be enjoyed far away from the race track.

However, as with all Lotus sports cars, aerodynamic downforce is also a requirement. This new GT-class coupé generated up to 64 kg of downforce (double that of the Evora 400), making it the new benchmark when compared to similarly priced rivals. The Evora GT was powered by a specially calibrated and tuned higher-output version of Lotus' supercharged, 3.5-litre 6-cylinder engine with an integrated water-to-air charge cooler. It produced 416 bhp at 7000 rpm and 317 lb-ft of torque from 3500 rpm, giving a 0-60 mph time of just 3.8 seconds. The automatic option had 332 lb-ft and returned a similar acceleration time. With all the additional lightweight options that were available fitted, the overall mass was further reduced to 3,104 lbs, giving a total weight saving of just over 70 lbs when compared to the Evora 400. The additional downforce was created by the efficient management of airflow under and over the car. A front lip, mounted beneath the lightweight composite grille mesh, reduced undercar airflow.

At the heart of the Evija was an ultra-advanced all-electric powertrain, which had been developed with technical partner Williams Advanced Engineering, famed for success in motorsport, from Formula One to electrifying the first four seasons of Formula E. The battery pack was mid-mounted immediately behind the two seats and supplied energy directly to four powerful e-motors.

This highly efficient system was the lightest, most energy-dense electric power package ever fitted to a road car. With a target weight of just 1,680 kg, the Evija was set to be the lightest pure electric hypercar ever to go into series production. Engineered for precise and sustained performance, the Evija had five driving modes – Range, City, Tour, Sport, and Track – and could rush from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in under three seconds and accelerate to a top speed of more than 200 mph (0-320 km/h).\n\nThe most striking element of the Lotus Evija was its exterior. From every angle, the full carbon-fibre bodywork appeared shrink-wrapped over the mechanical components. Unquestionably, the most dramatic element of the exterior was the Venturi tunnel that pierced each rear quarter. Inspired by Le Mans race cars, they optimized airflow by directing it through the bodyshell. This design concept, known as 'porosity', aided the delivery of high-energy airflow to the rear of the car. This, in turn, counteracted the low pressure behind the car to reduce drag. Furthermore, the Venturi effect inside the car stats: Battery Pack: mid-mounted, Energy Supply: direct to four e-motors, Target Weight: 1,680 kg, Acceleration: 0-62 mph in under 3 seconds, Top Speed: more than 200 mph.",

When viewed from the rear of the car, each Milestone Car tunnel was edged with a red LED to create a striking ribbon-style light signature. The result was a stunning visual effect that was akin to the afterburners on a fighter jet, especially when seen at night. As an extra detail, an LED hidden within each tunnel illuminated its interior. The directional indicators were incorporated into the corners of the ribbon, while the reversing light was provided by the illuminated 'T' of the 'LOTUS' wordmark above the integrated charging flap. Another key feature of the Evija's sophisticated aerodynamic system was the bi-plane front splitter. It was another illustration of form and function working perfectly in tandem.

When asked how the Evija's sophisticated aerodynamics compared to more regular sports cars, Richard Hill, the highly experienced senior engineer who has guided this critical element of the car's design, commented: \"It's like comparing a fighter jet to a child's kite.\" He further explained, \"It's about keeping the airflow low and flat at the front and guiding it through the body to emerge high at the rear. Put simply, it transforms the whole car into an inverted wing to produce that all-important dynamic downforce. Most cars have to punch a hole in the air to get through using brute force, but the Evija is unique because of its porosity. The car literally 'breathes' the air. The front acts like a mouth; it ingests the air, sucks every kilogram of value from it.

In the middle part of 2019, Director of Vehicle Attributes for Lotus Motorsport, Gavan Kershaw, and Vehicle Line Director at Lotus Cars, Neil Thomas, developed a plan to get Lotus back into racing on a long-term basis.

Evora GT Racecar Type 129 was built on the road platform which had been heavily influenced by Lotus motorsport-inspired engineering. The suspension used T131 wishbones and uprights with fully adjustable camber, toe, caster, and ride height with Ohlins TTX 36 dampers. The ABS braking system was supplied by Bosch. Gavan Kershaw, who also performed the duties of chief test and development driver, explained, \"Every Lotus is famed for its performance in ride and handling on challenging roads, surfaces, and through tight corners. This performance is borne from years of motorsport experience and testing at our test track in Hethel, something which delivers confidence, response, and feel to the customer.\" The reputation Lotus holds as a leader in intelligent engineering was preserved through the car's use of a lightweight carbon-composite body – optimized to ensure every gram serves a purpose.

It wasn’t just suited to its driver’s favourite road, but also fully at home on a challenging circuit.\n\nExige Cup 430 Final Edition Type 111",

Those instantly recognisable brand signatures and core values were combined with a paradigm shift in levels of practicality, comfort, functionality, and technology. Matt Windle, Managing Director of Lotus Cars, commented: “The Emira is a game-changer for Lotus. It stands as a beacon of everything we have achieved to date in the transformation of the business, the embodiment of our progress. It is a highly significant milestone on our path to becoming a truly global performance car brand.” The Emira was developed on an all-new lightweight bonded aluminium chassis technology pioneered by Lotus over the previous 25 years and which remains an intrinsic part of the company’s sports car DNA. In this instance, that innovative vehicle architecture was wrapped with a bold and sculpted design using cues clearly developed from the Evija.\n\nWith the first customer cars scheduled for delivery in the spring of 2022, the Emira's Car Stats are as follows: Model: Type 131, Name/Formula: Emira, Years of Production: 2021-22, Examples Built: currently in production, Engine Type: Supercharged Toyota V6 VVT-i or Turbocharged AMG i4, Engine Size/Power: 3456cc/400bhp or 1998cc/360bhp, Length/Width/Height: 174in/78.2in/48.2in, Wheelbase: 101.4in, Weight: 3097lb/1,405kg (lightest option).",
