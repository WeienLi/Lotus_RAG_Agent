The car was intended to take the Norfolk-based team back to the United States, where, with Jim Clark behind the wheel, the team had won the Indianapolis 500 back in 1965. Also, as only four drivers had ever managed to win both the 'Indy 500' and the Formula 1 World Championship, and as all of them – Clark, Hill, Andretti, and Fittipaldi – had driven Team Lotus cars to take their world title, this new venture was also sure to revive happy memories for race fans as well as Lotus watchers the world over.\n\nWinkelmann himself was an experienced hand at racing, running Brabhams in the mid-1960s and later in the decade enabling Jochen Rindt to establish himself as the man to beat in Formula 2.

Thought by contemporary commentators to clean up turbulence in this area (Lotus refused to confirm or deny this), and so reduce drag around the front wheels, their design was quickly copied by most of the rival teams. The cars ran an assortment of engines, using at various times throughout the season the EF4B (the low compression of which was excellent for high-boost qualifying sessions but carried with it the penalty of higher fuel consumption) and the latest EF15 power unit.

Leading the field at Detroit, the Nürburgring, Brands Hatch, and Adelaide, as well as at Imola and Silverstone - both at which he ran out of fuel in sight of the flag - he quickly became a favorite of race fans the world over, if not always with his fellow drivers. Taking pole seven times in the first season, De Angelis managed only one, Senna's driving style was tough but unmatched when it came to achieving what was needed. His first GP win, a superb drive in appallingly wet conditions, came at Estoril for the Portuguese Grand Prix. A second win followed at Spa Francorchamps.

The HCPI was for sale in markets such as the US, and the HC for the 'Rest-of-the-World'. The Turbo Esprit received a modest power and torque bonus. The raised compression ratio of the normally aspirated Excel SE was a hint of how the final Giugiaro Turbo models would be given new energy before Esprits were restyled for Autumn 1987.\n\nA Turbo Esprit HC premiered at the October 1986 London Motor Show. That occasion also marked another limited edition, based on HC running gear, one that anticipated celebrating twenty-one Lotus years in Norfolk. Sharing limited Earls Court stand space in the Autumn of 1986 were these two versions of the HC, both offering 215bhp at an unchanged 6250rpm (a 2.5% power cent bonus).",

Besides the new engine supplier, the most significant change to the car's makeup was the adoption again of the computer-controlled 'active' suspension system, which had been under development at Lotus since before the days of the Type 92. Powered by a hydraulic pump driven via a mechanical coupling to the rear of the left-hand side exhaust camshaft, it distributed hydraulic fluid to each suspension corner via a network of pipes with hydraulic actuators, controlled by electronically-operated pressure controlling valves. Pull-rods and wishbones were employed in the actual geometry, but in place of conventional coil-springs, the hydraulic actuators were the only true suspension medium. The biggest problem was accommodating the ancillaries which came with the new engine. This meant more wiring and more plumbing for additional sensors and control boxes, although the different cooling requirements of the Honda enabled engineers to opt for just one oil/water heat exchanger.",

In 1987, the team conducted extensive wind tunnel tests to determine the slippery shape of the new car. The big news was the new sponsor, the tobacco company RJ Reynolds, whose Camel colours replaced those of John Player Special in the newly named Camel Team Lotus Honda. Accordingly, a new Japanese 'second string' driver, Satoru Nakajima, was signed up to accompany the established team star Ayrton Senna. Even in Camel's distinctive yellow and blue livery, the car bore a strong family resemblance to its predecessors. However, with a smaller engine cover, narrower side pods, and no windscreen, it was a slightly sleeker machine with some subtle aerodynamic modifications made to the side pods and gearbox underbody area.

The new style car, code-named X180 by the factory, had been the work of a team of designers under the control of Lotus design director Colin Spooner and led by Peter Stevens, ably supported by Ken Sears. The fruits of their work were first seen when the new shape car was launched at the British Motor Show in October 1987, with delivery of the first cars going out to customers almost immediately.

After a long break between seasons,” he added, “I am really looking forward to getting back into a racing car – especially this one as it’s a completely new design.” The arrival of this extremely prestigious new number one driver – replacing Senna, who had defected to McLaren – was just part of the impressive arrangement with main sponsor R.J.

Lotus apparently wished to concentrate its efforts on developing the ‘active’ suspension for production cars, so the new car was, according to Technical Director Ducarouge, “a very classic racing car design. We have paid special attention to efficiency in both the mechanical and aerodynamic departments.” Bilstein’s input was crucial too, as Ducarouge admitted at the car’s launch, “we have lost a lot of ground in the field of suspension systems while we were off developing active suspension.” With its stretched nose, the car looked much longer than it actually was, an illusion strengthened by the more rearward location of the driver’s seat.

Its annual sales rates were higher than those of the originals, partially because the same power-trains and substantially the same car could be sold in all markets. If Lotus had a first 'world car', the Esprit SE was that machine.\n\nKey components of the revised car were assembled around the 910S-coded version of the familiar 4-cylinder, 16-valve unit with its single Garrett TB03 turbocharger, complete with water cooling and integral wastegate adopted in previous editions. The big changes were the installation of Delco Electronics’ GMP4 engine management that superseded the previous American emission specification and the more stringent European emission specification for markets like Switzerland.

The second major alteration, which increased power output by 14 percent and torque by 17 percent (totalling 264bhp and 261lbft respectively – to a remarkable 121.5bhp per litre), was a turbocharger and intercooling system that Lotus dubbed 'Chargecooling.' Connecting the turbocharger compressor output to the plenum intake nozzle via a finned Behr water-to-air intercooler with its own plumbing (i.e., not shared with the motor), the chargecooler itself was compact. Its pure water coolant was driven by an ancillary Jabsco pump slotted into the redundant distributor drive, feeding a separate front radiator of considerable cooling capacity.\n\nEsprit Turbo SE, Type 82, did not just enhance steady state output from 225 to 264bhp at peak (6500 rpm), it also allowed Lotus to engineer a temporary (under 30 seconds) overboost system. Here outputs on 95 octane fuel could reach 280bhp under sudden full throttle demand. More importantly, pulling power (torque) was enhanced over a wider engine range.",

The January 1986 takeover of Lotus by General Motors effectively terminated any plans for a Toyota-engined sports car, but plans were still afoot for a successor to the Elan. With some £35 million available to be invested in the project, this represented the largest such single investment in the company’s 43-year history. The intention was to produce between 3,000 and 3,500 Elans a year, a substantial increase over normal Lotus levels and a stated desire to see the company producing some 4,500 combined units annually by the mid-1990s (a marked contrast to the 1981 total of just 345 cars). The first priority for Lotus design director Colin Spooner was finding a suitable powertrain, preferably one which was not yet in production rather than an established unit. It was to be Isuzu who came up with the goods, namely a new-generation 16-valve, 1.6-litre straight-four, suitable for front wheel-drive applications and with an excellent power-to-weight ratio.

The latter was made not by gluing together two halves but by assembling numerous small mouldings made of a new non-shrink polymer developed by Ashland Chemical Company of Columbus, Ohio. The body's overall shape, with its unique 'cab forward' design, was the work of Peter Stevens, who successfully fended off rivals Giorgetto Giugiaro and GM's Chuck Jordan.\n\nFrom the start, Stevens' Elan was controversial.

This done, Lotus believed the car would be able to maintain its optimum suspension geometry under the hardest of cornering, braking, and – doubtless most significantly for the ever-growing list of customers placing orders at the dealers – acceleration.

For his first no-holds-barred Grand Prix design, the new Judd engine enabled Dernie to build a smaller, lighter car than before. So small in fact, that even Peter Warr was effusive. “You have to be impressed by the size of this car,” he told journalists. “It is so small that we don’t even have to walk around it anymore, we can just step over it even when the driver is on board.” Even so, Dernie had stuck by established Lotus principles, albeit with an appreciably longer wheelbase than before and with a waisted section on the front monocoque which widened to accommodate the cockpit. Significantly, the new car also passed the most stringent crash tests, and did so by a wider margin than any Team Lotus car had ever done.\n\nThe car’s intensive test program in Rio was to be shared by Piquet (still suffering from an injury to his ribs sustained in a fall on his yacht), Satoru Nakajima, and the team’s test driver and former Formula 3000 pilot Martin Donnelly.

Working to a different set of regulatory and drivability parameters meant comprehensive changes under the skin that were invisible to the casual observer. While UK sales looked good, sales overseas—always crucial to Lotus—were less so. Problems re-engineering the car to take airbags and larger bumpers, and the resulting price hike, pushed the diminutive Elan into Corvette territory, with a price tag in the USA nearly $10,000 in excess of that originally forecast. The Isuzu turbo engine, which in all markets needed to be fitted with a catalyst, was left pretty much alone, but the rest of the car was distinctly different. Longer, heavier, and with a much altered chassis and suspension setup for the larger wheels, the Federal car was launched after considerable delay, primarily due to the difficulty in meeting the US crash performance standards. Engineer Jerry Boone spent almost a year working on it.

The steering column also had to be changed to accept the airbag system that was obligatory in the US. With larger 16-inch wheels and tires fitted, the steering setup required a new approach and gave a quite different feel, especially at the lower speeds, necessitated by US speed limits. \"A much tauter response and yet a lighter overall feel,\" was how Lotus ride and handling guru Roger Becker described it. \"The handling is even better balanced and total grip potential is higher in wet or dry conditions.\" The widely varied and distinctly different road surfaces in the US played a big part of the equation, and tire development was a big challenge.",

This engine, mated to a new transverse-located gearbox, Dernie maintained, \"should give us more horsepower with reliability.\" Slightly longer but narrower than the Judd, the Lamborghini 80-degree V12 Tipo 3512 engine was also heavier and less fuel efficient. To some extent, this would be offset by its greater power output: 640bhp at 13,000rpm, and a revised gearbox using Lamborghini gears in a Lotus casing. Clearly, though, the challenge for Dernie and his team would be to accommodate the engine in such a way as to optimise the car's aerodynamic efficiency to such a point that the new combination would prove competitive. In a bid to keep the strong points of the Type 101 and delete the weaker ones, Dernie's solution was to locate the engine lower in the chassis, nestling neatly beneath the bodywork, and to further improve the vehicle's aerodynamics around the rear wing. With larger fuel tanks behind the driver extending across its entire width, the new car was also characterized by the following car stats:\n\nModel: Type 102\nName/Formula: Formula 1\nYears of Production: 1990\nExamples Built: 5\nEngine Type: Lamborghini 3512 V12\nEngine Size/Power: 3493cc/640bhp\nLength/Width/Height: 175in/84.5in/38.5in\nWheelbase: 116in\nWeight: 1102lb/500kg",

Despite the longer engine, the Type 102 increased in length by only 5 cm, largely thanks to the shortening of the distance between the engine and the gearbox output. To further offset the weight of the engine, every component on the car was scrutinized again to see how and where weight could be shaved off. The end result, according to Warwick, was that with a V12 engine, Lotus and its drivers were \"back in League One, racing together with the top teams and we intend to capitalize on it.\" His second, the Northern Irish Donnelly, was equally enthusiastic, clearly delighted to be competing in Formula 1: \"The car looks fantastic and I hope it isn't too long before we see it on the track.\"",

Beyond Becker's involvement, UK input was minimal. John Miles drove the car in one 24-hour event, but the program was largely the responsibility of the USA-based Pure Sports Inc. team, with assistance from former TWR technician Colin Marriott and powertrain engineer Alan Nobbs.

To comply with the new 1991 FISA safety and crash regulations, a new monocoque was constructed using the latest composite materials, in particular a mixture of high modulus and high strength unidirectional carbon fiber.

Thereafter, the plan was to use a conventional coil-spring/damper suspension set-up at each corner but operated in conjunction with an evolution of the company's 'active' suspension, which it called Lotus Suspension Dynamics. Far simpler than the system employed by the team from 1983 to '87, it was described by Peter Collins at the launch as \"controlled reactive.\" This switchable system certainly appealed to the team's drivers, Hakkinen and Herbert.

In its four-year production life, it introduced some significant mechanical changes, including power steering to the Esprit range. Thanks to the skills of the Lotus development engineers, the result was warmly praised by independent critics. Engine principles remained as before, but there were important new castings for major hardware such as the cylinder block, head, and sump. All featured additional stiffness, and the head and block offered enlarged coolant capacities. The gearbox torque rating was enhanced by Renault, and major changes accompanied the switch to power steering, including a wheel and tire uprate to 17-inch diameter wheels both front and rear, with Goodyear Eagle GS-A asymmetric tires.",

Working with Aerodyne, an experienced specialist manufacturer of advanced composite components, January 1993 saw Lotus initiate a number of design studies for an all-new road-going time-trial version of the previous year's Type 108 that could accommodate road-going group sets. Work progressed rapidly, with the first wind tunnel tests of the new monocoque being completed in March of that year. By mid-June the factory was ready for the first test rides of the prototype Lotus Sport time-trial bicycle, to be designated Type 110. Thereafter, it was back into the wind tunnel to confirm these performance improvements, the end result being a sophisticated all-composite monocoque with an aerofoil cross section, formed using unidirectional and balanced-weave carbon-fibre plies in an epoxy resin.

The bike competed for the first time in July 1993 on the Prologue of the Tour de France and was ridden by Erik Breukink of the Spanish ONCE team.

Unfortunately, this would be the best result of the year, although the Lammers Esprit was also dauntingly fast at Jarama, Spain for the third round of the Global series. Here, Lammers qualified just 0.5sec from pole and led the opening laps of the race, only to tumble down the order as its Michelins faded. In a year in which the lightweight Lotus was an inconsistent performer, some final promise at Jarama was snuffed out by a driveshaft failure, where the unfortunate McCarthy got just one lap. The second 1996 Esprit GT1 was assigned to the Dutch Racing Promotions, their finance fielding Mike Hezemans, partnered regularly by money man Alex Portman. Tenth overall at Nogaro went to Hezemans and Portman in a rare finish for this duo, who had qualified a troubled 13th on that occasion and seemed to get any trouble going the Lotus way. Lotus was prepared to sell further replicas of the Type 114 at £296,000 apiece, making this undoubtedly the most expensive Esprit with a factory list price.

The project team was given just 27 months to create, design, and build a unique power unit for a world-beating new supercar. A clean-sheet approach was adopted under the wing of former Ford engineer John Owen and Hugh Kemp, then director of powertrains at Lotus Engineering. In March 1996, an all-new Esprit GT1 racer was unveiled at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, the still-secret Lotus V8 lurking under its engine cover. Four days later, the secret was out, when the long-awaited 175mph Esprit V8 road car finally made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\nCoded 918 in all its production formats and rated at the same maximum power and torque figures throughout its 1996-2003 production life, the Lotus eight was suitably high tech as the first new company production engine since the 907 of 1972. It sported 32-valves, four overhead camshafts, and twin turbochargers.

The Elise was quickly heralded as a new breed of supercar – small, high-tech, and simple, offering brilliant performance and handling for the enthusiastic driver, the hallmarks of many classic Lotus designs. Named after the granddaughter of the flamboyant Italian head of Bugatti Industries and Group Lotus chairman Romano Artioli, the all-new car featured a futuristic, yet practical and proven epoxy-bonded aluminum spaceframe chassis, clothed in a compact and highly distinctive body designed by a team headed up by Julian Thomson. The new Type 111 was intended from the start to be a particularly strong, ultra-light, very fast design and fun to drive – a new 'Seven for the 1990s'. The press and public certainly thought so, and it quickly racked up numerous awards for design and innovation, including Car of the Year (What Car?), Top Sports Car (BBC Top Gear Magazine), and Best Designed New Car (from a poll of Car Magazine readers).

The novel construction, its all-up dry weight of only 690 kg (1520 lb), and hence the car's extremely high power-to-weight ratio, showed the company moving in a new direction. By seeking to minimize weight rather than simply maximizing power, Lotus aimed to improve on existing sports cars' braking, handling, and steering responses, while simultaneously reducing overall fuel consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions to more acceptable levels. In 1996, working with Hydro Aluminium Automotive Structures (which had also assisted Renault with the development of its rival, the heavier Sport Spider), the Elise demonstrated an entirely new approach to vehicle architecture and brought to roadcar design a truly affordable 'spaceframe' style structure. This was made of epoxy-bonded sections of anodized aluminum extrusions, the whole being clothed in composite body panels (constructed using the traditional hand-lay system) styled by Hethel's in-house design team.",

A particularly fine-tuned independent suspension system, comprising upper and lower wishbones, co-axial coil-springs, and inverted monotube dampers, ensured that the new car could provide the handling to match. And, just as importantly, the Elise was to be affordable. Lotus was planning an initial production run of 700 new cars per year. The Elise turned around the public’s perception of Lotus.

The development began on a road-going version of a turbocharged V8 Elise, and the team was trying to carry over as many components and systems as possible in order to reduce development time. The extruded aluminum chassis was the most substantial Elise component that would be used, although even then there were quite substantial changes.

Venting for the rear brakes was as innovative as the car's construction, with cool air entering through intakes at the front of the car. It was channeled down the inside smooth surface of the chassis main beams directly onto the brake discs. A rear wing acted in conjunction with both the top and under body sections of the car to create substantial downforce. The car retained the highly-praised driving characteristics of the Esprit, but further development of the racing engine was undertaken jointly by GTI Lotus Racing and Lotus Engineering in a bid to further improve its 1996 season performance.",

Transmission for both versions was handled by a six-speed Hewland sequential gearbox, marking the first time such a gearbox was fitted to a Lotus road car. Both cars utilized an AP Racing four-plate hydraulic clutch, similar to the one used by the Esprit V8. To ensure maximum rigidity, the chassis and suspension of the standard Elise were significantly revised, employing solid, fully rose-jointed racing suspension pick-ups to provide highly accurate, rigid, positive, and direct feedback. Race-spec Firth Rixson coil springs and Penske lightweight dampers were installed in both road and race cars. The wheels were competition-spec cast magnesium 18-inch Speedline, equipped with Michelin Pilot MXX3ZR18 tires.

In order to do this, the detail specification had been minimized without compromising performance and, of course, driver appeal. At the same time, the V8 GT became the focus of the Esprit continuous improvement program, and the development of this new addition to the Esprit range led to extensive mechanical and aesthetic refinements which included: a completely re-styled interior (which was also adopted on the full Esprit range), new heating and ventilation controls, a revised gearbox system and selector mechanism, a refined ABS brake system, a new windscreen wiper system, and an all-new alarm system. \"The V8 GT combines the engineering passion of the V8 with the pure momentum of the GT3,\" was how Lotus positioned the V8 GT in their range.\n\nAt the same time as the V8 GT was revealed, it was also announced that by February of 1998, when the first of the customer GTs were to hit the showrooms, the standard model Esprit V8, now sporting most of the GT car's updates, would become known as the V8 SE.\n\nAs for car stats:\n- Model: Type 82\n- Name/Formula: Esprit V8 GT\n- Years of Production: 1997-2001\n- Examples Built: 204\n- Engine Type: Twin Turbo Lotus 918, 32-valve V8\n- Engine Size/Power: 3506cc/350bhp\n- Length/Width/Height: 173.5in/74in/45in\n- Wheelbase: 95in\n- Weight: 2919lb/1324kg",

        "content": "Developed for the dedicated track fan and for fully-fledged motorsport applications, the Elise Sport 190 was a pure racer. At its heart was an extensively modified version of the standard 1.8-litre engine – each meticulously hand-built by race technicians at Hethel – kicking out a breathtaking 190bhp. This mighty powerplant was known, appropriately, as the VHPD, or Very High Performance Derivative, and could hurl the featherweight Sport 190 from standstill to 60mph in 4.3 seconds (0-100km/h in 4.4 seconds) and to 100mph in a supercar-bashing 10.72 seconds. As you would expect with this extraordinary level of performance, the Sport 190 was equipped with competition-modified suspension, brakes, wheels, and tyres, and an ultra-close-ratio gearbox, all fitted and set up by the same technicians who developed the car. Because each of the 48 Sport 190s was specially built to order by the Lotus aftermarket department (the prototype car pictured here was distinctively painted Chrome Green), each car could be tailored to specific customer requests; the list of options was extensive. The VHPD engine was the familiar transversely mid-mounted four-cylinder in-line, DOHC, four valves per cylinder unit. Changes over the standard engine comprised a modified cylinder head, valves, pistons, crankshaft, flywheel, and solid valve lifters.",

Introduced in January of 1999, the Elise 111S was the first model in the Elise range to be equipped with the MG/Rover Variable Valve Control (VVC) engine, a power source that Lotus had been hoping to use since the first Elise had been launched back in 1996. Always part of the Elise master plan, but subject to Rover’s constraints of production and politics surrounding the MGF’s premium engine, the VVC-powered evolution of the Elise was formally announced at the Geneva Show in the spring of 1999, with production having already begun in January that year. The launch price was £26,590, some £3,915 more than the starter price of £22,675 for the Elise.\n\nThe 111S running gear showcased the Lotus-AP racing opposed piston calipers now working cross-drilled 282mm cast iron disc brakes, whilst the wheel and tyre specification was also enhanced. At the back, new 7.5x16-inch 6-spoke alloys wore 225/45 rears rather than 205/50s on 7-inch rims. Front wheels, also of the 6-spoke design, remained at 5.5x15-inch.",

Minor detail trim changes included headlamp covers, white (rather than orange) front indicator lenses, a new moulded air-intake grille, rear wheel arch spats, 111S decals on the rear body and fascia panel, revised seat foams and stitching, and weave-patterned dash inserts.\n\nThe 111S was certainly a strong commercial success, taking up to half of all Elise sales during its commercial life, and it would not have achieved this popularity without its substantial re-engineering.
