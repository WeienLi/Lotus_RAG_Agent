The first race at Brands was quite quiet compared to what followed, as Formula Ford became well-known for its rough-and-tumble antics. The most successful driver of the 1967 season was Dan Hawkes, who drove a Motor Racing Stables Type 51 to victory in five of the season's Formula Ford races. In late 1967 or early 1968, a slightly modified model called the 51A was offered to customers. The Lotus was different from the Elan in several ways. The dashboard was now fully equipped and boasted a polished mahogany facia, through-flow ventilation, and a two-waveband radio, while the door trims were full-depth and needed no elbow cutouts. The boot was also much larger than the two-seater Elan's. Later cars had a deeper boot due to a change from a transverse exhaust silencer to a longitudinal unit. As launched in September 1967, the +2 cost £1672 in component form or £1923 including purchase tax fully built, although by January of 1968 this had become £1718 and £2113 respectively. The standard +2 continued to be sold alongside the +2S well into 1970, and with chassis numbers for the two cars listed on Lotus records as one model, exact production numbers are not available.",

This was despite strong competition from other manufacturers. 51B and 51C models were developed, primarily for sale in the USA. The 'B' featured updated and improved rear suspension with upper trailing links mounted to the top of the upright, while the 'C' models had a Hewland transaxle fitted.

It has to be noted that this wasn’t actually for Formula 3; it was in fact entered in several Formula 2 races in 1967. Powered by the new FVA engine from Cosworth, the 41B designation was actually intended to be for the 1967 Formula B spec car for use in the USA with Lotus Twin-cam power, but with the Formula 2 car taking its name, the FB car would confusingly be called the 41C. Only a single 41B spaceframe chassis was officially built to compete in 1967, and the combination did achieve some reasonable results against the other much more sophisticated monocoque machinery.\n\nOfficially entered by Lotus Components, and usually alongside the two green and yellow Team Lotus Type 48 Formula 2 cars for Jim Clark and Graham Hill, the 41B would race in white and black livery at 14 championship and non-championship races in a grueling 1967 Formula 2 season. After missing the first two races of 1967 at Snetterton and Silverstone, the 41B made its debut.\n\nType 41 Formula 3",

Although the Type 41 Formula 3 chassis had been finding plenty of success in the USA and Canada, good results in the 1966 European races were getting harder to come by. With Team Lotus concentrating their efforts on Formula 1, the Formula 3 car was not receiving the factory support and development that it needed in order to keep the customer cars up front in 1967. The 41B made its debut at the Grand Prix of Pau in early April, where, after an early pit stop, Oliver finished unclassified, ten laps down. At the non-championship Gran Premio de Barcelona a week later, Oliver started from tenth on the grid and crossed the line to finish in fifth place, albeit two laps down on the winner, Jim Clark in the Type 48.

At the Oulton Park Spring Trophy for Formula 1 cars, the organizers invited F2 cars to make up the numbers, and Lotus was the only team to take up the challenge, sending a Type 48 for Graham Hill and the 41B for Oliver. After Hill hit trouble in the first heat, Oliver took the only major race win for the 41B. After sixth and seventh place finishes at Crystal Palace and Reims, Oliver's F2 challenge in the 41B fell apart, and he never managed to finish another race in the car. Unfortunately, a string of DNFs meant he never even scored a point in the European F2 series that year.\n\n1967",

It featured unequal length wide-based wishbones with outboard coil-spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension, brakes, and gearbox all remained the same as on the 1966-67 versions of the car, with the wishbones, top links, and radius arms mounted on adjustable spherical bearings, outboard coil-spring/damper units, and an adjustable anti-roll bar.
