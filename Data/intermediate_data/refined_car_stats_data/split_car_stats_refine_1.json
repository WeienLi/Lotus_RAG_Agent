With more time to work on the car in between his undergraduate lectures at London University, the car really began to take shape. The chassis was scraped clean, then checked, painted, and given boxed main members by welding a fourth side to the 'U' section, or 'top hat', chassis rails. Colin did most of the work but was helped by his car sales partner Colin Dare, Derek Wootton, and girlfriend Hazel Williams. The facilities were basic in the extreme, so the end product reflected the lack of power tools, with just one borrowed electric drill, and panel-beating expertise; any brazing had to be done by a local welder. The bodywork was very angular, created by using aluminium-bonded plywood panels, no doubt the result of experience gained through Colin's University College engineering course. The body was constructed of angular panels with contoured edges. The rear end was extended so that two passengers, more commonly known as trials ballast, could easily be accommodated, and it was topped off with a hinged lid. There were no doors, merely cut-outs.",

The rear end was extended so that two passengers, more commonly known as trials ballast, could easily be accommodated, and it was topped off with a hinged lid. There were no doors, merely cut-outs in the body sides. The radiator surround was fashioned out of copper sheet and looked rather like a Rolls-Royce grille. Colin’s learning curve throughout the whole process reflected his innate engineering aptitude and natural talent for innovation on the cheap. One example of this was a clever design to overcome the Austin’s unfortunate habit of over-steering on corners as a result of the rear quarter-elliptic springs flattening as the body rolled. As his car was now going to be a trials car, he could not adopt the accepted solution to this problem, which was to replace the elliptic springs with flattened ones, because it reduced ground clearance to an unacceptable level. Instead, by swapping the axle casings from side to side and turning them upside down, he found a way to fit the flattened springs and still have adequate ground clearance. Problem-solving like this was to become the rule.",

As on the Mark I, the main Austin Seven chassis members were boxed-in, but the cross-members were removed and replaced with tubes welded in position. This provided a lightweight but stiff frame. Colin used the Ford split front axle, fitted with bushes and suspended from the front of the Austin Seven A-frame. However, he did not want to use the heavy Ford rear axle, preferring the lighter Austin Seven unit which was easier to connect to the four-speed Austin Seven gearbox that he used in place of the three-speed Ford unit. Not satisfied that the standard axle ratios were high enough for his use, he famously devised a way to increase the ratio. He used the 42-tooth crown wheel from one axle type, mated to the 9-tooth pinion of the other type, then filled the differential not with oil but with Bluebell metal polish. It was run for 50 miles in this fashion, and then pulled apart. The bearings had been destroyed but the crown wheel and pinion now meshed perfectly.",

It was in the engine department that Colin’s genius for speed was realized to the greatest extent. The standard Austin Seven engine had ‘siamesed’ inlet ports (that is, one port serving two cylinders), and Colin saw an immediate way to get more power out of the engine by the process of ‘de-siamesing’. This involved enlarging the openings in the cylinder block and fitting a dividing plate which was welded with bronze filler and meticulously shaped with rotary files, creating a separate passage to each inlet valve.

The solution was an angled 'snorkel' air intake, which, in ignorance of the de-siamesing, other 750MC competitors copied, thinking it was a clever Colin Chapman device for extracting more horsepower. A three-bearing engine was later used to solve the problem of bent connecting rods and oil-starved big end bearings. This engine had to be mounted on rubber mountings to stop the crankcase from twisting and the crankshaft breaking. This deprived the front of the chassis frame of rigidity, which, in turn, lowered cornering speed. The solution was bracing made with 14-gauge welded tubes that formed a cage-like triangulation around the engine.

The engine and gearbox were set well back in the chassis to keep as much weight as possible over the rear wheels, and the gaping hole between the engine and radiator was filled by another novel feature: two large Jerry cans filled with water. Unlike most trials cars, the Mark IV was a true dual-purpose car; it could be driven to the start of the event with the handling of a normal car. Once the Jerry cans were removed, the trial could be tackled with handling characteristics ideal for trials, but which made for tricky handling on normal roads.

The production chassis was a further minor development of the Mark VI tubular frame, being shorter than the Mark VIII's (although on the same wheelbase) and, as modified for the enveloping bodywork, had lighter gauge tubing in some areas. In January of 1955, Colin Chapman gave up his job at British Aluminium and committed himself to working full-time at Lotus. One of the first tasks for the year was to address a demand for a more advanced Mark VIII, with a smaller engine. Low weight and advanced aerodynamics remained the goals, and Frank Costin's brief was to design a body that would fit inside the new transporter, so the Mark IX had to be a full two feet shorter.

After the team's relative success at Le Mans, this model was renamed 'Le Mans'. In preparation for the 1955 season, Colin Chapman addressed customer demands for a Mark VIII with a larger engine by producing the Mark X. In fact, Colin was so enthusiastic about the project that this actually preceded the production development of the Mark IX. The 2-litre class was growing extremely popular, and the most successful cars (Cooper, Tojeiro, and Lister) used Bristol's 2-litre six-cylinder engine, a British-built version of the pre-war BMW 328 OHV engine that, with its triple Solex carburettors, could produce up to 125 bhp.

The Bristol unit was much more powerful than any engine yet fitted to a Lotus chassis, and in such a lightweight setting, obviously had tremendous potential. The Mark VIII based spaceframe had to be modified to enlarge the engine bay, and the problem of installing and removing the engine was solved by making two chassis members detachable. To offset the effect of the heavier engine up front, optimum weight distribution was achieved by placing the fuel tank behind the rear axle, along with the twin fuel pumps, the spare wheel, and the battery. It was decided to have a similar rear end layout that the Mark IX had employed—a de Dion axle with upright coil-spring/damper units. Chapman was concerned that the Mark VIII’s Lockheed Alfin drum brakes would be insufficient, so for this iteration, he chose the latest Dunlop disc brakes, mounted outboard with the wheels at the front and inboard alongside the differential at the rear.

Even using one chassis design, there could still be a wide variation in specification depending on the car's intended use. Hence, the Eleven was developed as a direct descendant of the Mark IX. The new type number was Mark XI, but the Press soon latched on to the way \"Eleven\" rolled off the tongue. With the added complication that 11 could be confused for '2', Colin decided to dispense with the 'Mark' designation. The engine was mounted over the Girling dampers nearer the center of the car. The rack-and-pinion steering was extremely narrow to line up with the axle pivot axis, and specially cut steering arms lowered the track rods.\n\nIn profile, the Frank Costin-honed Eleven was the smoothest Lotus yet. While the scuttle was the same height as the Mark IX, the hood and tail were more steeply raked, and the tail fins were reduced in height. If a stabilizing effect was required for high-speed tracks, a head fairing could be added together with a metal tonneau cover, producing the \"single seat\" version.

Plenty of people placed orders as soon as they saw the car, particularly members of the 750 Motor Club who had been eagerly awaiting. The Seven was not a direct follow-on from the Mark VI – with the works over-stretched building race cars, there was a gap of some two years between the end of Mark VI production and the launch of the Seven – but it was its spiritual successor, resembling it closely. While the Mark VI had used a spaceframe with larger section twin bottom rails, the Seven’s was a proper 1-inch diameter spaceframe designed to aircraft principles using the centre section, tunnel, scuttle, and axle mounts of the Eleven, with redesigned front and rear sections.

By the time the first customers were building up their kits, Colin Chapman (seen below left with the prototype Seven and Elite just visible) was already thinking about more power for the little sports car. A Coventry Climax engine had been fitted to the early pre-production car, and a handful of these were made to special order. In December 1958, a production version was offered with this engine. This was the legendary 'Super Seven', later also known as the Seven C. The Super Seven had a close-ratio Austin A30 four-speed gearbox and, with the 1098cc engine developing 75bhp, maximum speed was comfortably over 100mph: 0-60mph acceleration took only 9.2 seconds.

This engine produced 37bhp, which was a little more powerful than the Ford side-valve but was a lot more tuneable. It also formed the basis of the export Seven 'America', which used a 43bhp Austin-Healey Sprite A-Series engine. To satisfy American legislation, the 'America' did away with the non-swivelling front cycle wings in favor of sweeping wings—a modification which was soon to become standard for domestic models, too.\n\nWith production of the Elite delayed, the Seven took on an unexpected mantle as Lotus' main road car effort, and about 60 cars were built during 1958.

This time, the new Formula 2 twin-cam Coventry Climax FPF was an official factory option. To accommodate this particular 145bhp unit, the engine bay was made three inches longer than the 1956 car, with a corresponding lengthening of the wheelbase. Other dimensions were left mainly the same. In practice, almost every other component of the 1956 design was altered, making an obvious basis for a Type 13. However, superstition reigned, and the 1957 car was given the name 'Eleven Series 2'. At this point, the 1956 car began to be known as the Series 1. Major changes for the Series 2, apart from the much lighter wishbone suspension, consisted of a larger diameter de Dion tube with more substantial rear hub castings, plus a more bulbous body in the area of both front and rear wheel arches. At the rear, the bodywork was modified to accommodate the larger 550 section tyres fitted to the Climax FPF-powered version.

Interestingly, all Series 2 Elevens had the extra three inches length in the engine bay, which was a design legacy from only three, or maybe only two, LM 150 cars which required this. Apart from the front suspension, a second major feature carried over from the Type 12 was the option of the magnesium Wobbly Web wheels, which gave a useful reduction in unsprung weight.

However, experience soon revealed that the handling was affected appreciably by the changing load of the rear-mounted fuel tank.

There were essentially three members: the driveshaft, which located each wheel laterally, a single forward-facing radius arm, and the strut member (coil-spring and damper). These three converged into an aluminium casting containing two wheel bearings. The driveshaft was angled up by three degrees to provide slight negative camber. This arrangement benefited both unsprung and overall weight and reduced to a minimum the camber changes caused by fuel loading, making handling predictable.\n\nAt the front end was a double wishbone set-up with the top wishbone doubling as an anti-roll bar, plus coil-spring/damper units.

This 1475cc unit was extremely powerful and, once the teething problems of dropped valves and failed pistons had been overcome, very reliable.\n\nThe five-speed transaxle gearbox was developed by Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy, and the propshaft was set so low that it passed under the driver's seat. Gear changes were accomplished rather like they were in early motorcycles, via a zig-zag gate, which was perhaps the car's major failing—some at Lotus dubbed it the 'queerbox'. Gears could not be cut quickly enough in Britain, so Colin Chapman ordered these from ZF in Germany, as well as limited-slip differentials. It was the drawbacks of this gearbox that persuaded Colin that he needed to take on a transmissions development man, and that turned out to be Lotus Mark VI owner Keith Duckworth, who was hired in 1957.\n\nFor the bodywork, Frank Costin was again called upon.

For the bodywork, Frank Costin was again called in; he was well qualified, having designed the successful Vanwall Grand Prix single-seater. The shape was designed with minimal frontal area, and the radiator was inclined back to reduce the height of the bonnet line. In order to keep unsprung weight down, a different type of wheel was chosen, namely bolt-on (rather than knock-on) magnesium alloy disc wheels. It was preferable to keep the thickness of the alloy as thin as possible, yet it also needed to be strong, so a web pattern was devised. The bending strength of the wheel varied as the folds became deeper towards the center of the hub and shallower towards the rims. This arrangement also did away with holes or spokes, a great help in combating fatigue cracks.

He quickly decided to minimize the use of steel and build what would become the world's first workable, large-scale production automotive glass-fibre monocoque.\n\nStructurally, the car was composed of three major mouldings and derived its strength from eight box sections. At the rear, a triangular box provided attachment points for the final drive and suspension; the propshaft tunnel, sills, and roof provided front-to-rear stressed sections. The car's front-to-rear stressed sections were supported by the propshaft tunnel, sills, and roof, and at the front of the roof was just about the only piece of strengthening steel on the vehicle.\n\nIt was well known that Colin Chapman only really ever wanted to go racing.

The chassis-frame was wider and lower than the Type 12 and again used Reynolds round-edge bottom longerons and square uprights up front to enable easier suspension mounting. The frame was mainly formed of 20-gauge tubing with some 18-gauge members, welded together by Progress Chassis Company. At the rear, an unusual rubber sling supported the weight of both the fuel and oil tanks. Unlike the Vanwall, the new Type 16 was extremely low, achieved by seating the driver on the undertray and inclining the Climax FPF engine at 62 degrees – almost completely on its side – rather like in the Type 15. Additionally, it was offset 5½ degrees from the center line of the car so that the propshaft could run to the left of the driver. This linked up to a modified Lotus positive-stop gearbox with a new casing and required a lateral offset between the gearbox input and output shafts. The exhaust was fully enclosed by the bodywork to reduce drag, which it did, but there was obviously concern about the car's performance.",

Overall height, and therefore frontal area, was reduced by laying the dry-sumped twin-cam Climax engine virtually on its side, just degrees from the horizontal. The double-curvature windscreen was smoothly moulded in one piece, and a lipped top edge to the screen helped to reduce drag still further. The body featured a very smooth undertray and hinged front and rear ends, which could be quickly removed, and as before, the radiator was fully ducted so that the hot cooling air did not pass back through the engine compartment. The front suspension followed the now familiar Lotus formula of fabricated wishbones, and braking was also as before – by Girling discs, outboard at the front, inboard at the rear.

Because the gearbox was rear-mounted, there was plenty of space for the pedals, which were wide-spaced.

The central part of the chassis, braced on three sides only but drawing torsional rigidity from the structures around it, connected the scuttle hoop to the engine bulkhead. The rear chassis had an easily removable Y-shaped diagonal section which braced the engine bay. The front suspension was by unequal length double wishbones, with the latest modifications of a separate anti-roll bar, and easily adjustable camber angle. There was insufficient height at the rear to install the familiar strut suspension, so Colin designed an entirely new 'double transverse link' arrangement, formed by the lower tubular links and the unsplined driveshafts. Parallel radius arms ran rearward from the engine bulkhead to the bottom and center of the upright.\n\nFollowing the lead set by Cooper, the obvious answer was to put the engine behind the driver, whose size would then dictate the frontal area of the car. The rear-engined layout had been well proven, and Colin felt sure he could improve on what he considered their rudimentary suspension designs. Colin always said he regarded the Type 18 as the first true Formula 1 car he had designed and built, his previous front-engined car.",

Bristol saw production of the Elite as the ideal exploitation of their extensive expertise in glass reinforced plastic manufacture, in both aesthetics and construction. The Bristol plant built the chassis body units from a new set of molds supplied by Lotus, and technicians worked hard to make the finish of the molds as flawless as possible, in the hope that the resulting panels would be free of surface irregularities.\n\nThe first of these revised Series 2 Elite bodyshells were delivered to Cheshunt in July 1960, and Bristol would continue to supply chassis body units until the Series 2 ceased production in the autumn of 1963. With their much improved methods of working, these new shells showed a genuine improvement over the old Maximar units until complacency set in and workers at the Bristol plant began to 'cut corners' quite literally, and the quality of production dipped dramatically. Bristol was embarrassed and immediately rectified the problems that were occurring and took much greater care in the troublesome differential and radius mounting area.

The other major significant changes between the Series 1 and Series 2 versions of the Elite were, of course, in the suspension area. Born out of the experience gained from the race track as well as the 1960 demands of the customer, the Series 2 Elite received subtle yet effective revisions to both front and rear suspension. At the front, the dimensions of the springs were changed. Longer, softer springs, combined with new shock absorbers, gave a softer overall spring rate compared to the Series 1. A slightly changed lower wishbone, which had a more easily serviceable trunnion, was also adopted. For the rear end, fitting longer, softer springs and firmer dampers reduced the harshness of the ride but kept the race-track feel.",

With the rear end now bolted firmly through the bottom of the hub carrier, this new system with revised geometry further isolated chassis loads and virtually eliminated the rear wheel tracking problems of the earlier cars. Another new model in the Elite range arrived at the 1960 Motor Show, when a new Special Equipment model was introduced with uprated carburation and a tuned exhaust, producing 83 bhp.

There were indeed several ways that this was achieved: chassis members were reduced in number; flooring to the engine bay and rear axle areas was omitted; steering geometry was simplified, including the use of a straight column; a very favourable deal for the supply of rear axles from the Standard 10 was struck with the manufacturers, which now meant the same natural stud centres to all wheels without the need for adapting hubs; cheaper 13-inch diameter Triumph Herald wheels were sourced from Standard Triumph; rear axle location was simplified by the use of an upper trailing arm to each end and a single lower 'A' bracket connected to the centre, under the differential, which also gave lateral support; the expensive aluminium nose and front and rear wings were replaced with coloured gel coat glassfibre parts, which removed the need for painting.

His most memorable win was in the 1962 Daytona Continental Three Hours Road Race, when the engine's crankshaft failed on the final lap and, with a substantial lead, Gurney managed to complete the race using only the starter motor for propulsion. In the USA, several Type 19s were re-engined using larger capacity American powerplants, and late in 1963, a one-off car called the 19B was constructed by the Lotus works in the UK. This, the final Type 19 built, was commissioned by John Klug, founder of Pacesetter Homes Racing, for Dan Gurney to drive. Fitted with a small-block Ford V8 engine, which necessitated the use of modified and strengthened suspension, the 19B was delivered in October of 1963 and campaigned as the Pacesetter Ford during 1963 and 1964, with little success however.\n\nWhile the Type 15 had been reasonably successful in sports car racing, it had never made Lotus any money. Superseding the 15, the new Type 19 was based on the successful principles of the rear-engined Type 18, applied to a full-width sports racing machine.

The Type 21 was the new Lotus F1 car for 1961. Externally, it resembled the Type 20 (Formula Junior car), but under the skin there were several important differences. The troublesome Lotus gearbox (with its one tiny set of dog rings to pick up every gear) was abandoned in favour of a ZF gearbox, which the German company made exclusively for Team Lotus, in four and five-speed forms. Chapman had ordered it with the V8 engine in mind but it worked just as well with the four-cylinder engine.

The top wishbone was made of stainless steel and pivoted on a spindle which carried the entire front suspension load (a cross-brace was welded into the frame at an early stage to compensate). The inboard system alleviated a lot of drag and allowed for a lighter anti-roll bar. With much reduced power outputs in Formula 1, aerodynamics began to play a far greater role in ultimate success on the track, and the inboard system with its relatively clear airflow between wheels and body would be widely adopted by other constructors in coming years.

The Type 22's official debut was at the January 1962 Racing Car Show, where Lotus Components showcased its new Junior contender. With the Ford-Cosworth engine, the cost was £1550. Despite competition from Brabham and a £100 higher price than the Type 20, it was popular and sold well. Formula Junior had become a global phenomenon, gaining immense popularity in places like South America and Australia. Team Lotus works driver Peter Arundell achieved an impressive 18 victories out of 25 starts during the 1962 season, including the high-profile Formula Junior Monaco Grand Prix warm-up race, a record for the highest number of wins in one season.",

This remains a record for the highest number of wins in one season by one car in any FIA sanctioned international race series. It also follows that his car for the season, chassis number 22-FJ-02, is probably the most successful Lotus ever, in terms of pure race results. The Type 22's spaceframe was much stiffer than before, thanks to thicker gauge metal, a double-skinned bulkhead, and many detail alterations imparting extra rigidity. Jack Fairman in Motor Racing magazine commented: \"I'm sure most people will be really pleased to hear that Colin Chapman has put the extra weight into the frame. An over-exuberant type can give the Goodwood chicane a hearty clout with this one and still carry on motor racing.\" Following their homologation on the Triumph Herald, Girling disc brakes were standardised front and rear.

The Lotus 23 is the closest thing to the 22 Junior that it is possible to make that will carry a scaled down and smoothed out Appendix C, Monte Carlo style body.” The familiar spaceframe was splayed out to carry the wider bodywork, and torsional stiffness benefitted substantially from the increased cross-sectional area.

The impressive stiffness of this chassis gave him the idea that it could be used on a single-seater. His scheme was to space the sides of the backbone far enough apart for a driver to sit between them. It was all hatched at a lunchtime meeting with Mike Costin, when Chapman simply began sketching on a paper napkin. Straight after, he went home and drew up the general arrangement scheme of the first modern monocoque in Formula 1. He famously said afterwards: “Despite people telling me ever since that there were monocoque racing cars in 1911 or whenever, the Type 25 was the first as far as I was concerned – I had never seen one before, and we didn’t know if it would work.” The monocoque chassis was made from 16swg aluminum sheet, with the side members being long boxes containing the flexible fuel tanks and acting as the lower body half.

The chassis finished at the rear with a square section hoop to which the rear suspension arms were bolted. Triangular channels in the frame’s underside carried oil, water, and hydraulic and electrical systems. With a monocoque tub, less space was wasted, and the Type 25 boasted the slimmest body ever seen in Grand Prix racing. No formal aerodynamic tests were carried out, but the simple principle of keeping the bodywork as tight as possible over the components minimized frontal area and reduced drag.

It is no overstatement to say that the Lotus Type 25 revolutionized Formula 1 design. It was a complete break from conventional thinking, advanced even for Colin Chapman, and its development was one of the best-kept secrets in motor racing. The major revolution was to abandon the traditional tubular spaceframe in favor of an aircraft-style monocoque, literally meaning 'single-shell'. The Lotus Type 25 featured twin lower wishbones, tubular stub axles, and the steering box was mounted high on the chassis, level with the top suspension arm. The rear suspension included lower wishbones with a single inboard mounting point, a single upper arm, twin radius rods, and an anti-roll bar. The driveshafts had inboard rubber universal joints.

As such, the Elan became more up-market. Overall, its design had less of the Elite's uncompromised feel and far more regard for production viability and costings. The simple, deep backbone chassis was made of 18swg steel with local 16swg stiffening, and weighed a mere 75lb. The central box section measured 11½ inches by 6 inches and served as the propshaft tunnel while each end of the chassis forked out into narrower sections. Cross-members and turrets at the front cradled the engine, gearbox, steering, and suspension, and the rear housed the final drive and suspension. The suspension consisted of pressed steel wishbones with coil-spring/damper units at the front and, at the rear, a wide-based lower wishbone and coil-spring/damper unit set-up; the lower end of the strut fixed in a cast aluminum housing which contained the wheel bearings and hubs, as well as lugs for mounting the Girling disc brakes. These were mounted in a semi-inboard position at the rear, near to the Rotoflex rubber.",

The body, designed by Ron Hickman, was moulded in two main glassfibre sections: floorpan/arches and upper body, which were then bonded together. Steel strengthening for the door jambs made it sufficiently rigid to not have to rely totally on the chassis for its strength. Clean aerodynamics favoured a pop-up headlamp arrangement, which was worked by two vacuum cylinders. The front and rear bumpers were made of plastic and filled with polyurethane foam. With very little frontal area to work with, Colin Chapman again used his ingenious method for the placement of a number plate at the front.

And there you have it, a perfectly legal airflow number plate! Whatever else can be said of the Type 14 Elite, it had been a salutary experience for Lotus. The monocoque bodyshell had been a brilliant idea, but it was an ambitious move for such a small company. The Elite lost Lotus money, and there had to be a better way. Colin Chapman saw it in the backbone chassis, which would become a Lotus hallmark for years to come. The backbone chassis concept made its roadcar debut in the Type 26 Elan, a model which was crucial to the future of Lotus.\n\nIn 1962, Chapman wanted a twin overhead camshaft engine for the Elan and turned to Harry Mundy of The Autocar magazine. Mundy, formerly with BRM and Coventry Climax, agreed to develop a double overhead-cam cylinder head. Preliminary work was on the 3-bearing 109E block, until the Ford 116E 5-bearing block became available. The alloy heads were initially made by J.A. Prestwich, and then later on by Lotus itself.",

As announced, the Elan engine displaced 1498cc and was basically a detuned version of the same unit that had powered the Lotus 23, famously driven by Jim Clark to near success at the Nürburgring earlier in the season. The head, pushrods, timing cover, and water pump of the original OHV engine were discarded, and Lotus fitted the Mundy-designed, aluminium DOHC head. However, the 100bhp engine was quickly superseded by the definitive 1558cc, 105bhp version, with twin-Weber carburettors. Almost all (probably 15 of the 22) examples of 1.5-litre Elans were subsequently recalled and converted to 1558cc spec.\n\nThe car stats are as follows:\n- Engine displacement: 1498cc (later 1558cc)\n- Power: 100bhp (later 105bhp)\n- Carburettors: Twin-Weber\n\nThe four-speed gearbox was derived directly from the Ford Classic, though the final drive ratio (in Lotus’ own aluminium casing) was 3.90 instead of 4.125.

As a direct development of the Type 25 Formula 1 car and therefore Lotus’ first monocoque Junior car, it was much more compact than the 22 which it replaced – being considerably narrower in the chassis area. In competition, the Type 27 eventually proved itself to be more sophisticated than all the other FJ racers. Matters improved and opened the door for the 27 to challenge the mighty Brabhams.

Gurney had been impressed when he had seen the Type 25 in Formula 1 and thought a lightweight, mid-engined car could do well against the heavy and predominantly front-engined Indy Roadsters. A lightweight, low-powered car which could run on regular pump fuel (most ran on methanol) was viewed with skepticism, but tests showed that the slower speed on normal fuel was outweighed by better economy, meaning fewer time-consuming pit stops. Ford went for Lotus, and the Type 29 was born.\n\nIn general principle, the construction of the Type 29 monocoque followed that of the Formula 1 Type 25. It was wider, taller, and had a five-inch longer wheelbase, partly because of the regulations (which set a minimum wheelbase length of 96 inches) and partly because of the room needed to accommodate the Ford V8 engine. Lotus also cited the considerably taller stance of Gurney, compared to Clark, as another reason for the increased dimensions. The side members were 1¼ inches deeper and slightly wider than the 25's, and were increased in size to accommodate the following car stats:\n\nModel: Type 29\nName/Formula: Indycar\nYears of Production: 1963\nExamples Built: 3\nEngine Type: Ford Fairlane V8 Pushrod\nEngine Size/Power: 4195cc/370bhp\nLength/Width/Height: 150in/65in/30.5in\nWheelbase: 96in\nWeight: 1130lb/513kg",

The side members were 1.25 inches deeper and slightly wider than the 25’s, and were increased in size to accommodate 42 gallons of fuel to minimize pit stops. The engine came from Ford of America, which supplied an all-aluminium, dry-sump 4.2-litre V8 engine. In place of the usual fuel injection, Lotus preferred four DCOE 58 Weber carbs, and claimed the V8 Ford developed around 400 bhp at 7000 rpm. With a power-to-weight ratio of approximately 800 bhp per ton, Lotus felt justified in claiming that this was “one of the most, if not the most, potent pieces of racing machinery ever built, surpassing even that of the pre-war Mercedes and Auto-Unions,” and went on to say that the Type 29 could be expected “to break almost every circuit lap record.” A rear-mounted, four-speed Type 37A Colotti gearbox was used with two ratios blanked off.

When Colin Chapman saw the 1962 race, he exclaimed, “All you’ve got to do is to get an engine with half the power of these great lumps of junk, build a decent chassis, and you’ve won the race.” Coincidentally, Ford of Dearborn also had plans for the Indy 500.

As for the steel wheels, these were swapped for wider, center-lock, magnesium wheels. Another change was stiffer, shorter springs for a lower ride height, which in turn meant raising the height of the differential to compensate for the acute half-shaft angles.

There were dual-circuit brakes with twin master cylinders, light-alloy calipers with racing pads, and a revised pedal layout to ease heel-and-toeing. The standard engine was a Cosworth tuned version of the Twin-cam, which produced at least 140bhp and eventually delivered as much as 160bhp. The gearbox and limited-slip differential were now cased in magnesium. The 26R proved a strong racing competitor, particularly in club events. A Team Lotus works car was campaigned and driven in several races by Team Lotus mechanic Ray Parsons, but many private teams raced 26Rs, including SMART (Stirling Moss Automobile Racing Team) and Team Willment. The latter fitted a 158bhp BRM Phase 2 Lotus engine and, with John Miles at the helm, won the 1966 Autosport Championship. During 1965 and 1966, Ian Walker used one of his 26Rs [LRO 8C] in several road rallies both in the UK and Europe, scoring some good results, including 1st overall in the 1966 Jacobean Rally. In early 1965, the Series 2 Elan road car was produced.",

In early 1965, the Series 2 Elan roadcar was coming on line and thus prompted the development of a 26R 'Series 2'. First shown at the 1965 Racing Car Show, the S2 car featured a number of revisions designed to increase power and improve handling. As ever, factory records for 26R production are somewhat vague and feature missing, and or duplicated chassis numbers throughout the production of Series 1 and Series 2 cars, from 1964 to 1966. The commonly accepted number of 26Rs officially built is 97, but it is probable that more than 100 cars came off the line at Lotus Components in varying specification that often makes it hard to identify a true 26R amongst the many 26R replicas that were built in the day.",

        "content": "Perhaps Colin was driven by the fact that Ford, with whom he had developed a close association, had chosen Lola as its Le Mans partner and he wanted to upstage them. In any event, he had his way and went on to develop the Type 30. The backbone chassis of the Type 30 was inspired by the road-going Elan: a central box section with a rear Y-fork (which accommodated the mid-mounted engine and suspension assemblies) and a deep transverse box section at the front to carry the suspension. The central backbone was panelled in 20-gauge mild steel (found to be not stiff enough and uprated to 16-gauge after the first three chassis had been built); housed inside it was a 3-gallon rubber fuel tank (additional 9-gallon tanks could be installed in each of the body sills). Front suspension was by semi-trailing unequal length double wishbones and coil-spring/damper units, while at the rear the usual reversed lower wishbones and radius rods were supplemented by another novelty – upper wishbones. Rubber driveshaft couplings were once again specified. The four-spoke 13-inch alloy wheels were a development of the Indianapolis (Type 34) wheel, and enclosed Girling 11-inch solid discs at each corner.",

The engine was Ford’s cast-iron 289 (4.7-litre) V8. As purchased from Ford in Hi-Performance tune, it developed 271bhp, but after Lotus had modified it and added four Weber carburettors, it produced around 350bhp. A ZF five-speed gearbox was fitted, and with the highest final drive ratio, a 200mph top speed was theoretically possible. Although the prototype displayed at the London Racing Car Show had an aluminium body, production cars got glassfibre bodywork. This was extensively wind tunnel tested because there was natural concern about front end lift at high speed. There were many development teething troubles, but the first car went to Ian Walker-Team Lotus in time for the 1964 Aintree ‘200’ – and Jim Clark came second. He would follow this up with the 30’s only major victory at Mallory Park, but the opposition was hardly first-rate and the Walker team effort petered out before the end of the season.",

At the 30's first transatlantic outing at the Canadian Grand Prix, Clark stalled on the grid and retired four laps later with overheating. A better result awaited in October when Clark came home third in California. The overheating problem was recurrent and was eventually cured by re-piping the cooling system. Poor braking also dogged the 30, and Series 1 cars never had particularly rigid structures. There was also concern that the Ford V8 was underpowered, although the lightness of the Lotus frame compensated. The 30 was offered to the public at a reasonable £3,495, and the first private sale was to David Prophet, who raced extensively in South Africa. Some twenty-one examples of the Series 1 car were built. For 1965, a Series 2 version arrived.

Formula 3 represented a considerable step down in power terms, even from Formula Junior. While other constructors pursued more advanced methods of construction, Lotus, in effect, backpedaled. By now, tubular steel construction had been abandoned by Lotus in its single-seaters, but it was felt that the monocoque construction was not suitable, in terms of cost and repairability, for Formula 3. Its solution was to revise, in mild terms, the 1962 Lotus Type 22 Formula Junior car and introduce it as the Type 31 Formula 3 car.\n\nThe chassis was basically the same as that of the 22: round and square section tubing with a bulkhead which held the instruments and the steering column bracket, at the forward end of the cockpit. Suspension at the front was by unequal length double wishbones, an anti-roll bar, and outboard Armstrong coil-spring/damper units. At the rear was the classic Lotus system of single upper links, reversed lower wishbones, double parallel radius arms, anti-roll bar, and coil-spring/damper units.
