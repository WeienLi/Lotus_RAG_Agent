Hill was always very quick, but lady luck eluded him, and Clark scored all of the Lotus F1 wins that season, including the non-championship race at Jarama. On the 1st of January, 1968, Clark won his 25th – and final – GP victory in the Type 49 at Kyalami in South Africa before his tragic death driving the Formula 2 Type 48 at Hockenheim in Germany. Thereafter, the Type 49s wore the red, white, and gold colors of Gold Leaf Team Lotus, reflecting the team's new sponsorship deal with Players. At a time of crisis for Team Lotus, Graham Hill won the second Grand Prix of the season, the Spanish GP at Jarama (above), launching both himself and the team towards World titles in 1968.\n\n1967 Formula 1 Type 49 Milestone Car:\n- \"I think this new engine is going to win some GPs and, if we are lucky, we could even win the World Championship.\"\n- Walter Hayes: 78",

As such, the chassis was lengthened by a foot and the track widened by seven inches; overall length went up by 23 inches. A new steel backbone chassis was developed along similar lines to that of the Elan's. It was longer and featured pierced holes to reduce weight. The familiar front and rear Y-fork arrangement remained, with crossmembers carrying virtually identical suspension. The differential was mounted under the rear crossmember, located by torque arms attached to the main chassis and suspended by arms on the alloy casing; these arms were initially insufficiently strong (because the +2 was some 315lb heavier than the Elan), and so a thicker casting was soon substituted. Braking was by Elan-type discs but, for the first time ever as standard on a Lotus, a brake servo was fitted (and twin servos in certain markets). The discs were protected from dirt by shields, and all road tests commented on the excellence of the brakes. The wheels were 5½x13 pressed steel discs with centre-lock fixings.

The engine was not uprated at all, so performance did suffer slightly compared to the Elan, but not by as much as might be expected, mainly due to the better aerodynamics of the sleek new bodyshell. Top speed was in excess of 120mph, and the 0-60mph sprint could be achieved in around eight seconds.

The new glass-fibre body, styled by Ron Hickman, was based on the M20 prototype called the Metier, which Lotus had built while still at Cheshunt. All Elan +2 cars were built at Hethel and were only ever available in fixed-head coupe form. The longer and more sloping roof line, longer boot, and lower, sleeker front end with pop-up headlamps mounted on the flat front panel gave much improved aerodynamics. Rear lamp clusters on early cars were Alfa Romeo units, before changing to Lucas fittings, which were later supplied to Jaguar for use on the Series 2 E-type.

        "content": "In 1967, a brand new racing formula intended for beginners was introduced. The new Formula Ford category was for single-seaters powered by a Ford Cortina GT pushrod engine and fitted with narrow 'road going' wheels and tyres. Lotus was in a good position to satisfy demand for such a racer, and it dusted off the old Type 22/31 spaceframe and developed it into the Type 51 specifically for Formula Ford. This did call for some chassis changes, however, specifically at the rear to make the Cortina engine fit. Formula Ford cars ran broadly standard 1.5-litre Cortina GT engines, with single twin-choke Weber carburation, which were lightly tuned to develop around 80-90 bhp. A 1600cc version of the Ford 'Kent' engine was soon adopted, with the title FF1600.\n\nOtherwise, the specification of the Type 51 was very familiar. The multi-tube spaceframe had a steel undertray, fabricated bulkhead and roll-over bar, and the suspension was by unequal-length wide-based front wishbones and, at the rear, twin radius arms, wishbones and top links, with outboard coil-spring/damper units and a non-adjustable anti-roll bar at both ends. The brakes were Girling outboard discs (9 1/4-inch front, 9 3/4-inch rear) with an adjustable balance bar, and the rack-and-pinion steering was standard.",

Following an appearance by nine Jim Russell cars in a ‘Libre’ race on June 11th at Snetterton, the first official ‘Formula Ford’ race was in July, on the 1.24-mile Brands Hatch short circuit, and as part of the BARC Trophy Races meeting. Of the twenty cars shown on the preliminary entry list, no fewer than ten were Lotus 51s, all of them Motor Racing Stables cars (a further five were Jim Russell Racing Drivers School Lotus 31s). In his Type 51, George Lewis led from pole but spun at Paddock Bend, which left ex-serviceman Ray Allen in another Type 51 to sprint ahead almost unchallenged to take the chequered flag. A trio of Lotus 31s came in next, followed by two other 51s – Peter Wardle in fifth and Edmund Patrick in sixth place.\n\nThat first race at Brands was pretty quiet compared to what followed, as Formula Ford became well-known for its rough-and-tumble antics.
