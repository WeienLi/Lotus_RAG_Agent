        "content": "When the post-war UK fuel ration was abolished in 1947, Colin’s career as a novice\ncar dealer came to an abrupt end and, with more time to work on the car in between\nhis undergraduate lectures at London University\n, the car really began to take shape.\nThe chassis was scraped clean, then checked, painted, and given boxed main\nmembers by welding a fourth side to the ‘U’ section (or ‘top hat’) chassis rails. Colin\nMODEL\nMark I\nNAME/FORMULA\nTrials Car\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n194\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nAustin Seven two-bearing side-valve\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n747cc/15bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n112in/50in/52in\nWHEELBASE\n75in\nWEIGHT\n902lb/417kg\ndid most of the work, but was helped by his car sales\npartner Colin Dare, Derek Wootton and girl-friend\nHazel Williams.\nThe facilities were basic in the extreme, so the\nend product reflected the lack of power tools (just one\nborrowed electric drill) and panel-beating expertise;\nany brazing had to be done by a local welder. The\nbodywork was very angular, created by using\naluminium-bonded plywood panels, no doubt the\nresult of experience gained through Colin’s University\nCollege engineering course. The body was constructed\nof angular panels with contoured edges. The rear end\nwas extended so that two passengers (more commonly\nknown as trials ballast) could easily be accommodated,\nand it was topped off with a hinged lid. There were no\ndoors, merely cut-outs in the body sides. The radiator\nsurround was fashioned out of copper sheet and looked\nrather like a Rolls-Royce grille!\nColin’s learning curve throughout the whole process\nreflected his innate engineering aptitude and natural\ntalent for innovation on the cheap. One example of\nthis was a clever design to overcome the Austin’s\nunfortunate habit of over-steering on corners as a result\nof the rear quarter-elliptic springs flattening as the body\nrolled. As his car was now going to be a trials car, he\ncould not adopt the accepted solution to this problem,\nwhich was to replace the elliptic springs with flattened\nones, because it reduced ground clearance to an\nunacceptable level. Instead, by swapping the axle\ncasings from side to side and turning them upside down\nhe found a way to fit the flattened springs and still have\nadequate ground clearance. Problem solving like this\nwas to become the rule rather than the exception.\nSpecial actuating cams were fitted to the brakes\nand the linkage was modified. The Austin engine was\ncompletely overhauled, given a higher compression\nratio, and a specially made inlet manifold and was fitted\nwith double valve springs. The weak Austin carburettor\nwas swapped for a Ford downdraught type.\nAfter a year of work, the Austin Special [PK 3493]\nwas completed in the spring of 1948, and Colin\nimmediately took part in a number of trials\naccompanied by Hazel as passenger. However,\nthis competition experience revealed some minor\nweaknesses in the car. The rear end needed larger\nsection tyres, so Ford steel disc wheels were substituted\nfor the Austin Seven wire wheels. Also, in pursuit of\ngreater control, the front beam axle was split and\nhinged in the centre to create independent front\nsuspension. The car was later given a new registration,\nOX 9292, taken from another 1928 Austin Seven.\nBy now Colin had noticed that Austin Seven\npower was not really competitive in these events and\nhe quickly embarked on the construction of his next\nproject, a Ford-engined car, and the first one to be\ncalled a Lotus (subsequently named the Mark II).\nIt was not until after his Lotus Mk II was sold to\nMike Lawson that Chapman decided to call his first car\nthe Lotus Mark I (a reconstruction of which is pictured\nabove), and his second the Mark II. Thus the first car\nto have the word Lotus on the drawings before\nconstruction began would be the Mark III.\nIn early 1947 Colin Chapman had his first taste of\nmud-plugging trials as passenger to good friend\nDerek Wootton. Fired with enthusiasm, he joined\nthe 750 Motor Club and started to make his own\ntrials car from a 1928 Austin Seven, an unsold item\nfrom his second-hand car selling business, regist-\nered PK 3493. Whilst this was being built behind\nhis girl-friends parents’ house in Alexandra Park\nRoad, he entered his first trial in a borrowed MG.\nTrials Car\nMark I\nThe40s & 50s\n“Looking back on this period, we can only\nwonder at the progress achieved by Colin\nChapman and his band of volunteers.”\n1948-59"

        "content": "Unlike the Mark I, the Mark II was conceived as\na state-of-the-art trials car, which at the same time\nwould be usable on the road. As on the Mark I, the\nmain Austin Seven chassis members were boxed-in,\nbut the cross-members were removed and replaced\nwith tubes welded in position. This provided a\nlightweight but stiff frame.\nColin used the Ford split front axle, fitted with\nbushes and suspended from the front of the Austin\nSeven A-frame. However, he did not want to use the\nheavy Ford rear axle, preferring the lighter Austin\nSeven unit which was easier to connect to the four-\nspeed Austin Seven gearbox that he used in place\nof the three-speed Ford unit. Not satisfied that the\nstandard axle ratios were high enough for his use, he\nfamously devised a way to increase the ratio. He used\nthe 42-tooth crown wheel from one axle type, mated\nto the 9-tooth pinion of the other type, then filled the\ndifferential not with oil but with Bluebell metal polish.\nIt was run for 50 miles in this fashion, and then pulled\napart. The bearings had been destroyed but crown\nwheel and pinion now meshed perfectly. Now, instead\nof a 5.25:1 or 4.9:1 axle ratio, he had achieved 4.66:1.\nFor an engine, Colin acquired a Ford 8 side-valve\nunit. Using this he attempted a couple of minor trials,\nbut it was quickly apparent that it was not up to the\nMODEL\nMark II\nNAME/FORMULA\nTrials Car\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n194\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nFord 8 side-valve, later Ford 10\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1172cc/25-30bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n108in/55in/55in\nWHEELBASE\n79.5in\nWEIGHT\n980lb/445kg\n194\nTrials Car\nMark II\njob, so he cleverly masterminded a deal to acquire an almost-new Ford 10 engine\nand gearbox from a burnt-out car, effectively without needing to pay for it.\nWith the new 1172cc Ford 10 engine in place, the Mark II was much more\ncompetitive and Colin became even more dedicated to motor sport, so much\nso that he left the Royal Air Force.\nFor the 1950 season, the engine was left in standard form, and the Mark II’s\nsuccess in its first full season speaks for itself, especially when it is remembered that\nColin worked every other weekend, and, from April 1950 had a new job at British\nAluminium. By the end of July, Hazel and Colin had scored four outright wins,\nfour class wins and numerous second and third place finishes in trials events.\nPerhaps the most important event in Colin’s life so far was his participation in\nthe ‘Eight Clubs’ race meeting at Silverstone on June 3rd. This was the first time\nhe had taken part in a motor race, and he soundly beat a Type 37 GP Bugatti\ndriven by Dudley Gahaganin in the Mark II. He was hooked! From then onwards\nhis attention was focussed on circuit racing, and although he took part in a few\nrallies, his thoughts were on 1951, and plans to win the 750MC Formula road\nrace championship.\nThe Mark II was sold to Mike Lawson who campaigned it in trials, and then\nto Major Eric Beaumont in Northern Ireland. By early 1957 the Mark II was\nback on the mainland and cinema-goers saw the car in the Boulting Brothers film\ncomedy ‘Brothers in Law’. The car ended up with Hampshire trials enthusiast\nArthur Hay and, when in 1989 he came to sell both it and the Mark IV he also\nowned, the Mark II was bought by Lotus enthusiast Nigel Halliday, who has\nkept it in original, un-restored, but fully running condition.\nBy the summer of 1948 Colin\nChapman had graduated as a\ncivil engineer and, in the autumn\njoined the RAF on a short course\nat Tern Hill, Shropshire. The hope\nwas that this would lead to a\ncommission, but other matters\nwould intervene. It was only just\nbefore this time that the Mark II\nwas conceived and began to be\nbuilt. During this time Colin had\nto devote all his 48-hour passes\nand leave periods from the RAF\n,\nto work on the car.\n"

        "content": "Once again the Seven’s chassis members were boxed\nin and tubular cross members replaced the flimsy\nAustin ones. New rear extensions were fabricated\nfor the petrol tank and telescopic shock absorbers.\nSoon after making the first frame, Colin met\nbrothers Michael and Nigel Allen who lived locally.\nHe persuaded them to help him build his car in their\nwell-equipped garage, and in return they would\nproduce two further Mark IIIs, one for each of them.\nAgain there was a split Ford Eight front axle\nwith springs mounted above, thereby providing\nindependent front suspension. The Ford axle was\npreferred because of its tougher king pins, even though\nit was heavier than the Austin’s. At the rear, the Austin\nsprings were set flat and given a much softer rate.\nA remote control Austin Nippy gearbox drove through\na 4.9:1 ratio back axle. An Austin Seven steering box\nwas laid on its side, the drop arm actuating separate\ntrack rods via a transverse drag link and swinging\nbracket. For braking, there was a Lockheed hydraulic\nsystem employing Girling drums and twin leading\nshoes in front, plus a Morris Minor handbrake\noperating on the rear wheels.\nWeight was kept extremely low: the whole car\nweighed just 815lb (370kg), mainly because the\naluminium body was so slender and weighed only 65lb\n(29.5kg). It had strengthening hoops and a 22-gauge\nundertray. The wheels were lightweight too, specially\nmade by the West London Repair Company.\nIt was in the engine department that Colin’s genius\nfor speed was realised to the greatest extent. The\nstandard Austin Seven engine had ‘siamesed’ inlet\nports (that is, one port serving two cylinders), and Colin\nsaw an immediate way to get more power out of the\nengine by the process of ‘de-siamesing’. This involved\nenlarging the openings in the cylinder block and fitting\na dividing plate which was welded with bronze filler\nand meticulously shaped with rotary files creating a\nseparate passage to each inlet valve. Of course a new\ninlet manifold with four pipes was also required, but\nthis was cleverly disguised with refractory tape to look\nfrom the outside as though there were only two.\nThe adapted inlet manifold was fitted with a huge\nStromberg twin-choke carburettor taken from a\nFord V8 engine, each choke being mated to its\ncorresponding port on the manifold, thereby achieving\nthe effect of a twin-carburettor system. The result was\na hugely powerful ‘standard’ 747cc engine, with a top\nspeed recorded at Silverstone in excess of 90mph and\na 0-50mph acceleration time of just 6.6 seconds. After\nthey had finished the first three frames and most of the\nparts, it became obvious that they would not make\ntheir ambitious target of racing all three at Castle\nCombe on 12th May, so it was decided to concentrate\non just the initial car, which was registered as LMU3.\nThey finished it in time to race at Castle Combe,\nbut on the drive down to Wiltshire a problem came to\nlight: fuel was being blown into the driver’s face. The\nsolution was an angled ‘snorkel’ air intake, which in\nignorance of the de-siamesing, other 750MC\ncompetitors copied, thinking it was a clever Colin\nChapman device for extracting more horsepower!\nA three-bearing engine was later used to solve the\nproblem of bent connecting rods and oil-starved big\nend bearings. This engine had to be mounted on\nrubber mountings to stop the crankcase from twisting\nand the crankshaft breaking. This deprived the front\nof the chassis frame of rigidity, which, in turn, lowered\ncornering speed. The solution was bracing made\nwith 14-gauge welded tubes that formed a cage-like\ntriangulation around the engine. The bracing was\nfitted with high-strength bolts, so that if the engine or\nhead needed to be removed, the tubes could simply be\ntaken away. Cornering speed was regained.\nMODEL\nMark III\nNAME/FORMULA\n750 Formula Car\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1951\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nAustin Seven three-bearing side-valve\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n747cc/40-50bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n125in/58in/39in\nWHEELBASE\n81in\nWEIGHT\n815lb/370kg\n750 Formula Car\nMark III\nAfter Colin won the Castle Combe event, the Mark III continued to perform\nimpressively in its first season, and proved hugely successful – faster than any other\n750 car. It was even used for Colin and Hazel’s vacation in Scotland, where it broke\ndown and returned on the back of a lorry! The Lotus Engineering Company was\nformed on 1st January 1952. The arrangement was that Colin would continue his\nday job at British Aluminium and Nigel Allen would continue his training as a\ndental surgeon, both working at Lotus in the evenings and on weekends, whilst\nMichael Allen worked full-time at the stables behind Colin’s father’s Tottenham\nLane pub."

        "content": "Mike Lawson who had been campaigning the Mark II\nin trials events, was finding it increasingly outclassed,\nso in November 1951 he approached Colin Chapman\nwith an order to produce a superior trials car, which\nwould become the Mark IV\n. This was one of the\nspurs Colin needed to set up Lotus Engineering with\nMichael and Nigel Allen. The plan was to manufacture\nand convert components for enthusiasts building their\nown cars. This was to take place either at Tottenham\nLane in Hornsey, or at the Allen family’s house at\nnumber 104 Vallance Road, rather than in the\nAlexandra Park Road lock-up.\nLotus Engineering’s car building programme\nbegan with the Mark IV\n. Once again this used a\nboxed-in Austin Seven chassis frame and a slightly\nlarger body than the Mark II’s. Given the registration\nplate LMU 4, it was an archetypal trials machine,\nand was the first of the Lotus cars to feature the\nnow iconic squarish nose cone echoed in the later\nMark VI and the Seven.\nIn June 1952, the second Mark III rolling chassis\nconstructed (later dubbed the Mark IIIb) was sold\nto Adam Currie for £125. With the help of volunteer\nPeter Ross, it was assembled with a second-hand\n1172cc Ford Ten side-valve engine block bought\nfor just £4 from a local Ford dealer. Built to compete\nin the new 1172 Formula, which would officially\nbegin at the start of 1953, ONK as the car became\nknown (taken from the cars registration plate), was\nfinally completed in time for the last Silverstone\nrace of the season, in October.\nMODEL\nMark IIIb\nNAME/FORMULA\n1172 Formula Car\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1952\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Ten side-valve\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1099cc/50+bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n125in/58in/39in\nWHEELBASE\n81in\nWEIGHT\n845lb/383kg\nThe layout of ONK followed that of the earlier Austin\nengined car, save that the Ford engine had a cast iron\ncrankcase (instead of aluminium) strong enough to\nstiffen the frame without the crankshaft breaking,\nobviating the need to have a detachable framework as\nhad been used to prevent twisting of the earlier chassis.\nThe car was painted black and had a power bulge\nover the carburettor. The remainder of the chassis was\nas for the Mark III, including the Austin 7 hydraulic\nbrake conversion with the usual twin leading front\nand conventional rear brakes. The rear axle was\nfrom a 1931 Austin Seven Chummy.\nFor £50 Len Pritchard and Charlie Williams\nagreed to build a replica of the Mark III body, which\nwas later finished with a coat of high-gloss black paint.\nTo allow the car to also compete in under 1100cc\nSports Car class, the engine was linered down from\n1172cc to 1099cc and carried a Scintilla Vertex\nmagneto, which accounted for the rather unsightly\nbulge on the bonnet of the car that appeared\nfollowing its first race at Silverstone.\nThat Silverstone race would be Adam Currie’s\nfirst ever motor race and, after leading at the start he\nmanaged to finish an encouraging sixth. The following\nyear Adam had an eventful season and, despite being\ndogged with engine unreliability, took nine awards.\nIn 1954 the Mark IIIb was sold to motor racing\ncommentator Tony Marsh who continued to race it\nwith much success, before passing through the hands\nof several owners. Thankfully though, the Mark IIIb\nhas survived to the present day in close to original\ncondition and is owned by an American collector.\n1952\nTrials Car\nMark IV\n1172 Formula Car\nMark IIIb\nThe suspension followed Mark II practice, but at\nthe front a novel device (affectionately known as the\n‘jelly-joint’) was fitted. This allowed the transverse\nspring to pivot at a central point, giving no resistance\nto roll (as on a tractor) – ideal for a challenging\n‘section’. Another clever feature adopted after damage\non the first event, was hinging cycle mudguards: when\nfaced with a tricky narrow climb, the driver could\nhop out and turn the mudguards inwards, thereby\nmaking the car narrower to avoid damage.\nA Ford Ten side-valve engine transmitted power\nvia a Ford Eight gearbox to an Austin Seven back axle.\nThe engine and gearbox were set well back in the\nchassis to keep as much weight as possible over the\nrear wheels, and the gaping hole between engine and\nradiator was filled by another novel feature: two large\nJerry cans filled with water. Unlike most trials cars,\nthe Mark IV was a true dual-purpose car; it could be\ndriven to the start of the event with the handling of\na normal car. Once the Jerry cans were removed,\nthe trial could be tackled with handling characteristics\nideal for trials, but which made for tricky handling\non normal roads. It was also fitted with lights and\nwas intended to have a basic hood, although Nigel\nAllen recalls that the fitter got the measurements\nwrong and thinks it was never actually installed!\nAs delivered to Lawson at his garage in Thornton\nHeath, in Surrey, LMU 4 had a single carburettor,\nbut this was soon changed to a twin-choke item.\nEventually Lawson had to succumb and remove\nvarious items to reduce weight in order to remain\ncompetitive with the increasingly extreme opposition\nfaced in trials. He also removed the jelly-joint,\nwhich had proved problematic, in favour of\na Ford beam axle in a bid to stiffen the suspension\nand reduce weight. Changes to the National\nRegulations for trials cars obliged him later to\nmove the engine and gearbox forward in the chassis.\nIts first event was the Kentish Border\n‘JB Taylor Cup Trial’ on the 16th of March\n1952 when the white Mark IV acquitted itself\nwell in Lawson’s hands. The car achieved a class\nwin on only its second outing, the Colmore Trophy\nTrial, in March 1952. After two more class wins, this\nwas followed by a victory at the daunting Motorcross\nevent at the Wool Heath tank-testing ground.\nMike Lawson competed regularly in the Mark IV\nuntil the end of 1954, during which time outstanding\nresults included runner-up in the French Sporting Trial\nat Annecy, a second team trophy in the TV Trial and\nwinning the Roy Fedden Trophy.\nThe Mark IV passed through several owners\nbefore being bought by a trials enthusiast Arthur Hay\n(who also owned the Mark II) and then to Martin\nHalliday, a trials specialist, who presided over a loving\nrestoration. Almost all of its original parts remain,\nincluding the original rounded nose cone, which is\nquite different from the later square front, which\nappeared in most of the period photographs.\n12"

The passenger side of the cockpit\nwas covered by a metal tonneau, there were spats\nover the rear wheels, and twin tail-fins provided\nadded aerodynamic stability.

        "content": "the way to the circuit! Incidentally, this was the first\ntime that the independent name of Team Lotus was\nused, signalling Colin’s higher aspirations for his racing\noperations. At the Oulton Park race, Colin shared the\nfastest lap with Gammon’s Mark VI, before retiring\nwith a blown gasket. After a few more troublesome\nraces, SAR 5 scored its first class win at Silverstone in\nMay, and following an abortive visit to the Eifelrennen\nmeeting at the Nürburgring late in May, at the BARC\nCrystal Palace meeting in June, Colin led from Roy\nSalvadori’s 2-litre Maserati before retiring. At Brands\nHatch on 4th of July Colin had to give best to Peter\nGammon’s Mk VI on this twisty circuit, and he\nfinished behind him in all three races, although he did\nhave the distinction of setting a new class lap record.\nHowever, the crowning glory of all Mark VIII races\nwas at the British Grand Prix meeting at Silverstone\non 17th July. Colin Chapman had the satisfaction of\nwinning the supporting 1500cc race in his own car,\nbeating Gammon’s Mark VI and Hermann’s works\nPorsche. John Coombs finished fourth in his\nConnaught powered Mark VIII, but Nigel Allen in\nhis first race in a Mark VIII (with MG power) retired. Another Team Lotus\nmember, Mike Anthony, finished ninth in his Lotus-MG Mk VI. Not surprisingly,\nTeam Lotus won the Team Award. By the end of the 1954 season, with what must\nhave been the fastest 1500cc car in the country at the time, Colin had finished 28\nraces with five outright wins and four class wins. After being advertised for sale in\nSeptember 1954, SAR 5 was sold in 1955 for another successful season with its\nnew owner Austin Nurse who up to then had been driving the ex-Fred Hill Lotus\nMark VI with 750cc supercharged MG engine.\nAfter the start of the 1954 season a number of privateers began demanding\nMark VIIIs, the first being John Coombs, Nigel Allen and Dan Margulies. The\n‘production’ Mark VIIIs differed from the prototype in many ways, not least\nthe chassis design.\nIn order to ease the maintenance problems associated with SAR 5 (pictured\nabove in June 1954), Colin reverted to the earlier Mark VI chassis, but with several\nimportant differences. The rear of the chassis was radically changed in order to\naccommodate the de Dion rear axle (which now had a Panhard rod for lateral\nlocation) as well as the same chassis-mounted differential with its inboard brakes\nas on the prototype. The production body shells were made in 18swg alloy and\nwere similar to the prototype, but without the rear air outlet in the boot lid. Engine\nchoice was left to the buyer, as were variations in body shell details. The Mark VIII\nusually competed in the 1½-litre class, but Dick Steed had the honour of being\nColin’s chosen customer for the first superb new 1100cc Coventry Climax FWA\nengine available to them and in this case mated to an MG TC gearbox. As only\nthe third FWA to be used in a sports-racing car, this was the first ever to appear\nin a Lotus. His car was registered HUD 139 and first raced at Castle Combe on\n28th August. Mark VIII production finished in early 1955 with the delivery of\nthe seventh car to Tip Cunane, which became known as the ‘White Lotus’,\na car that was more recently owned by Dutch Lotus enthusiast Olav Glasius."

        "content": "The Mark IX had higher, thicker and shorter rear fins and access for maintenance\nwas improved substantially by making the entire upper half of the front bodywork\nremovable; there was also a panel in the tail for access to the final drive and inboard\nbrakes. The production chassis was a further minor development of the Mark VI\ntubular frame, being shorter than the Mark VIII’s (although on the same wheelbase)\nand, as modified for the enveloping bodywork, had lighter gauge tubing in some areas.\nIn January of 1955 Colin Chapman gave up his\njob at British Aluminium and committed himself\nto working full-time at Lotus. One of the first\ntasks for the year was to address a demand\nfor a more advanced Mark VIII, with a smaller\nengine. Low weight and advanced aerodynamics\nremained the goals, and Frank Costin’s brief\nwas to design a body that would fit inside the\nnew transporter, so the Mark IX had to be a\nfull two feet shorter!\nAt the start of the season the first two production\ncars used Alfin aluminium brake drums, but these\nwere later replaced by an in-house design using cast\nElektron drums with fins which fitted more tightly\ninside the wire wheels. A Ford steering box was fitted\nand the de Dion rear end was revised using stronger\ncast aluminium hub carriers. Two cars with 1098cc\nCoventry Climax FWA power units were initially\ndisplayed to the press in March 1955.\nThese were the pair that went to the USA and were\ndoing well in the Sebring 12-Hour race, in fact leading\nthe 1100cc class, until one car was disqualified for\nreceiving a push-start and the other ruptured its sump\nafter a minor ‘off’.\nAlthough the Team Lotus works cars were externally\nsimilar to the production version sold to customers,\nthey were very different under the skin. For the first\ntime, under the influence of Frank Costin, aircraft\nprinciples were also used in the chassis design, resulting\nin a precisely engineered space frame with tubes sized\nto meet the anticipated structural loads. The first car\nbuilt, 9 EHX, had a 1467cc MG engine with ultra-\nlight magnesium alloy bodywork to offset the weight\nof the cast iron engine block.\nColin Chapman was delighted when the Mark IX\nwas accepted for the 1955 Le Mans race and a second\nworks car, XPE 6, with the same lightweight chassis\nframe, 1098cc Coventry Climax engine and new\nstyle Girling disc brakes, was built specially for this\nrace. This car, and all subsequent Mark IXs, was\naluminium-bodied. Colin and Ron Flockhart piloted\nXPE 6 at Le Mans, and had worked their way up to\n27th place when Colin was black-flagged for reversing\non to the track after a minor ‘off’ that took him into\na sand trap. The Mark IXs quickest lap averaged over\n97mph, making it the fastest car in relation to the\npower available.\nAlongside a cheaper Club version, with a Ford\nside-valve engine, gearbox, back axle and drum brakes,\ncustomers were also offered a Climax-engined Mark\nIX at £1150 plus purchase tax complete; after the\nteam’s relative sucess at Le Mans this model was\nrenamed ‘Le Mans’.\nMODEL\nMark IX\nNAME/FORMULA\nSports Racing Car\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1955\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n30\nENGINE TYPE\nCoventry Climax FWA, MG XPAG or Ford Ten\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1098-1467cc/50-70bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n142in/56in/27in (33.5in with screen)\nWHEELBASE\n87.5in\nWEIGHT\n924-1008lb/419-457kg\nIn preparation for the 1955 season, Colin Chapman\naddressed customer demands for a Mark VIII with\na larger engine by producing the Mark X. In fact,\nColin was so enthusiastic about the project that this\nactually preceded the production development of the\nMark IX. The 2-litre class was growing extremely\npopular, and the most successful cars (Cooper,\nTojeiro and Lister) used Bristol’s 2-litre six-cylinder\nengine, a British-built version of the pre-war BMW\n328 OHV engine that, with its triple Solex\ncarburettors, could produce up to 125bhp. The idea\nwas to install this Bristol engine into the familiar\nLotus Mark VIII/Mk VI chassis combination.\nThe Bristol unit was much more powerful than\nany engine yet fitted to a Lotus chassis and, in such\na lightweight setting obviously had tremendous\npotential. The Mark VIII based spaceframe had\nto be modified to enlarge the engine bay, and the\nproblem of installing and removing the engine was\nsolved by making two chassis members detachable.\nTo offset the effect of the heavier engine up front,\noptimum weight distribution was achieved by placing\nthe fuel tank behind the rear axle, along with the\ntwin fuel pumps, the spare wheel and the battery.\nIt was decided to have a similar rear end layout\nthat the Mark IX had employed – a de Dion axle\nwith upright coil-spring/damper units. Chapman\nwas concerned that the Mark VIII’s Lockheed Alfin\ndrum brakes would be insufficient, so for this\niteration he chose the latest Dunlop disc brakes,\nmounted outboard with the wheels at the front and\ninboard alongside the differential at the rear.\nIn silhouette the Mark X was almost identical to\nthe Mark VIII except for the absence of rear wheel\nspats and a very obvious 2½-in high bonnet bulge to\nclear the tall Bristol engine. This was despite the fact\nthat the engine had been lowered as far as possible\nby dropping the whole transmission. Lotus offered\n1955\nSports Racer\nMark IX\nSports Racer\nMark X\n18"

Hence the Eleven was\ndeveloped as a direct descendant of the Mark IX.\nThe new type number due was Mark XI, but the\nPress soon latched on to the way “Eleven” rolled\noff the tongue. With the added complication that\n11 could be confused for ‘2’, Colin decided to\ndispense with the ‘Mark’ designation.\nmounted over the Girling dampers nearer the\ncentre of the car. The rack-and-pinion steering\nwas extremely narrow to line up with the axle\npivot axis and specially cut steering arms\nlowered the track rods.\nIn profile, the Frank Costin-honed Eleven\nwas the smoothest Lotus yet. While the scuttle\nwas the same height as the Mark IX, the\nbonnet and tail were more steeply raked and\nthe tail fins were reduced in height. If a\nstabilising effect was required for high-speed\ntracks, a head fairing could be added together\nwith a metal tonneau cover producing the\n“single seat” version. The front end was very\nsmooth thanks to its tiny air intake and its\nhead and side lamps being mounted behind\nPerspex covers. The single-piece nose and\ntail sections could be swung up on cam\nhinges and easily removed for complete\nmaintenance access.\nThree models were available from the basic\nEleven package. The Le Mans model was for\nserious racers, having a choice of Coventry\nClimax engines: 1098cc FWA or 1460cc FWB\n(the latter producing up to 105bhp at 6200rpm),\neach canted at an angle of ten-degrees in order\nto reduce frontal area. The gearbox was\nnormally an A30 fitted with special close-ratio\ngears, but a tougher, much heavier, MG box\ncould be specified for long distance racing. The\nLe Mans version had de Dion rear axle, located\nby two pairs of radius arms, one of which was\ntriangulated into an A-frame to locate it\nlaterally. Ultra-light Girling calipers were used\ninboard at the rear (with calipers mounted\nahead of the axle) and outboard up front\n(the calipers being behind the axle). At\n9½-inches in diameter, the brake discs were\ngenerously sized for such a light car. The cost\n1956\nSports Racer\nEleven\nwas £1337 for the Le Mans 75, an extra £50 for\na Stage 2 tuned Le Mans 85 version, and an\nextra £250 for the 1.5-litre model.\nNext came the Club model for those less\ncommitted to competition use, which naturally\ncost less to buy (starting at £1083). It had a Nash\nMetropolitan live rear axle instead of a de Dion\ntube, but it was similarly well located. In place\nof disc brakes it had hydraulic drum brakes all\nround. A full-width screen was normal and a\nrudimentary hood and frame listed as an extra.\nFinally, there was a Sports model, intended\nmainly for road use and occasional competition,\nparticularly in production car classes (for which\nthe Eleven Sports qualified). The only difference\nbetween the Club and Sports models was the\nengine: in place of the expensive Climax unit\nwas a 1172cc Ford side-valve engine and three-\nspeed gearbox. It may only have only boasted\n36bhp in standard form but was normally\nsupplied upgraded with twin SU carburettors\nand higher compression producing 45bhp. The\nprice – £872 – was persuasive for many. If\ncustomers built their car up from a kit, these\nprices were also excluded from Purchase Tax.\nIn the 1100cc or 1500cc class, the Eleven’s\nonly real rival was the rear-engined Cooper.\nElevens were tremendously successful in 1956.\nWorks Elevens raced at Le Mans that year, Peter\nJopp and Reg Bicknell winning the 1100cc class,\nwhilst the 1500cc car driven by Chapman (seen\non this page at the Oulton Park British Empire\nTrophy race in April 1956) and Herbert Mackay\nFrazer and a third car driven by Cliff Allison\nand Keith Hall were forced to retire.\n1956 was a fantastic racing year for Lotus,\nwith the Marque recording an astonishing\n148 first places, 134 seconds and 99 thirds.\nAfter the success of the works Mark IX cars with their properly stressed\nchassis frames, Colin was convinced that this was the way to go. Thus, the\nEleven chassis layout employed much thinner-walled (18swg) steel tubing\nand ¾-inch subsidiary tubes than had been used on the production Mk VI,\nVI, VIII, IX and X cars. Even lighter 20-gauge steel thickness was reserved\nfor Team Lotus and valued customers’ cars.\nThe front swing axle set-up was again followed, but with a lower pivot\nthan before in order to reduce roll centre height.

This was located by trailing\narms with lateral location and had coil-spring\ndampers. At the front, the suspension system\ncame from the Series 2 Lotus Eleven: a set-up\nof twin wishbones, which incorporated the\nanti-roll bar, plus coil-spring/dampers.\nThe brakes were of Triumph Mayflower\norigin, with hydraulically operated drums\nat the front, and similar from the Nash\nMetropolitan at the rear. The handbrake lever\nwas horizontally operated above the passenger\nfootwell, so extreme care had to be exercised\ncare when yanking it on. Initially, a Burman\nsteering box was fitted, but this was imprecise\nand very soon swapped for a modified Morris\nMinor rack, mounted upside down. In late 1959\nthis was again changed, for a similar rack\nfrom the new Triumph Herald.\nThe standard power plant was the Ford\n100E side-valve unit producing only 28bhp and\na three speed gearbox, but at least Lotus was\nresponsive to the customer who wanted more.\nTwin SU carburettors and a modified exhaust\nmanifold were available to bring the power up\nto 40bhp, and there were also close-ratio gears\noffered for the transmission.\nThe Seven’s body was a stark, door-less\naffair with front cycle wings. The seats, dash,\nside panel trims and tunnel cover were finished\nin red Vynide, but the rest of the interior was\nleft bare. Weather equipment (hood and sticks)\nand windscreen wipers were optional extras,\nas was a rev counter, but there were no\ndirection indicators.\nAlthough it was offered fully built for\n£1036 including Purchase Tax, most, if not all,\ncustomers bought the car as a kit. At launch,\na kit of parts would have set you back £526.\nCompared to other kits of the day, that was\nexpensive, but Lotus supplied everything\nbrand new, even the engine and gearbox. This\nwas a novelty at the time, in clear contrast to\nthe much less sophisticated Mark VI kits that\nhad been available.\nThe Seven was launched at virtually the\nsame time as the Type 14 Elite, in October of\n1957. Plenty of people placed orders as soon as\nthey saw the car, particularly members of the\n750 Motor Club who had been eagerly awaiting\nThe Seven was not a direct follow-on from the\nMark VI – with the works over-stretched building\nrace cars, there was a gap of some two years\nbetween the end of Mark VI production and the\nlaunch of the Seven – but it was its spiritual\nsuccessor, resembling it closely. Whilst the Mark\nVI had used a spaceframe with larger section\ntwin bottom rails, the Seven’s was a proper\n1-inch diameter spaceframe designed to aircraft\nprinciples using the centre section, tunnel,\nscuttle and axle mounts of the Eleven, with\nredesigned front and rear sections. Like the\nMark VI, it was panelled in aluminium, with\na stressed floor and tunnel.\nthe successor to the Mark VI. Ultimately,\nhowever, nobody received their kit until\nwell into the spring of 1958.\nBy the time the first customers were\nbuilding up their kits, Colin Chapman (seen\nbelow left with the prototype Seven and Elite\njust visible) was already thinking about more\npower for the little sports car. A Coventry\nClimax engine had been fitted to the early\npre-production car and a handful of these\nwere made to special order. In December\n1958, a production version was offered with\nthis engine. This was the legendary ‘Super\nSeven’, later also known as the Seven C.\nThe Super Seven had a close-ratio Austin\nA30 four-speed gearbox and, with the 1098cc\nengine developing 75bhp, maximum speed\nwas comfortably over 100mph, with 0-60mph\ntaking only 9.2 seconds. With Graham Hill at\nthe helm, the Super Seven immediately began\nwinning races. It cost about £120 more than\nthe standard car, which would soon become\nknown as the Seven F\n.\nIntroduced the following year at the Motor\nShow was the Lotus Seven A, with the BMC\n948cc engine taken from the Austin A35/Morris\nMinor. Producing 37bhp, this engine was a\nlittle more powerful than the Ford side-valve\nbut was a lot more tuneable. It also formed\nthe basis of the export Seven ‘America’,\nwhich used a 43bhp Austin-Healey Sprite\nA-Series engine. To satisfy American\nlegislation, the ‘America’ did away with the\nnon-swivelling front cycle wings in favour\nof sweeping wings – a modification which\nwas soon to become standard for domestic\nmodels, too.\nWith production of the Elite delayed, the\nSeven took on an unexpected mantle as Lotus’\nmain road car effort and about 60 cars were\nbuilt during 1958. The increasing workload of\nthe Lotus empire at this time led the company\nto move from its Hornsey base to a much\nlarger factory not far away in Cheshunt.\nAnother thing to be said of the Seven was\nthat it brought in the funds that Lotus needed\nto get the Elite into proper production. The\nSeven itself was also a costly car to make,\ntaking many man-hours to put together what\nwas essentially just a few pieces of metal.\nThe chassis in particular, sub-contracted to\nthe Progress Chassis Co., was a somewhat\nexpensive item.\n1957\nSeries 1\nSeven\nMilestone Car\n“What other machine can offer such initial acceleration, running\neconomy, handling, dry weather grip, and sheer motoring fun?”\nJohn Miles\n22"

        "content": "To address this concern, Colin Chapman designed an extremely simple but elegant\ndouble wishbone arrangement for his first single-seater, the Type 12. This used a\nminimum of components, but its geometry was so sound that the same design was\nused for almost twenty years on his small single-seaters, and all versions of the Seven.\nThe clever part of the design was to integrate the anti-roll bar with the top-link thus\nforming an upper wishbone.\nColin Chapman had used swing axle front\nsuspension on all his cars to date, but in the\nback of his mind he had a concern that the\ngyroscopic effects of the front wheels would\ncause unwanted steering effect as the speed\nof the cars increased, even though at the end\nof 1956, when the Eleven S1 record breaker\nhad lapped Monza at over 140mph, neither driver\nwas on record as complaining about the stability.\nThe 1957 Series 2 Eleven Sports racing car (with the\nnew wishbone front suspension carried over from the\nType 12) was designed to accept a range of engines, but\nthis time the new Formula 2 twin-cam Coventry Climax\nFPF was an official factory option. In order to\naccommodate this particular 145bhp unit, the engine\nbay was made three inches longer than the 1956 car\nwith a corresponding lengthening of the wheelbase.\nOther dimensions were left mainly the same.\nIn practice almost every other component of the\n1956 design was altered, making an obvious basis for a\nType 13. However superstition reigned and the 1957\ncar was given the name ‘Eleven Series 2’: at this point\nthe 1956 car began to be known been as the Series 1.\nMajor changes for the Series 2, apart from the much\nlighter wishbone suspension, consisted of a larger\ndiameter de Dion tube with more substantial rear hub\ncastings, plus a more bulbous body in the area of both\nfront and rear wheels arches. At the rear, the bodywork\nwas modified to accommodate the larger 550 section\ntyres fitted to the Climax FPF-powered version.\nAlthough few parts were interchangeable with the\nSeries 1, to the casual observer the Series 2 was little\ndifferent to the earlier car.\nAs before, three basic specifications were offered:\nLe Mans, Club, and Sport.

Interestingly all\nSeries 2 Elevens had the extra three inches length in the\nengine bay which was a design legacy from only three,\nor maybe only two, LM 150 cars which required this.\nApart from the front suspension, a second major feature\ncarried over from the Type 12 was the option of the\nmagnesium Wobbly Web wheels, which gave a useful\nreduction in un-sprung weight. Quite a few customers\ntook up this option, but probably did not realise, until\nthey came to change a wheel, that Colin Chapman had\n‘designed out’ the front hub and placed the roller races\nin the wheel itself!\nEven the rear hubs were narrower and had smaller\nraces than the wire wheel version. Normally the\nLe Mans was sold with the FWA 1100cc Climax and\nA30 gearbox, but a stronger, but much heavier MG\nMagnette box was an option available for long distance\nevents. Again the Club version had a Nash Metropolitan\nsolid rear axle with drum brakes all round, whilst the\nSport kept to this arrangement but with the ubiquitous\nside-valve Ford up front. This option made an excellent\n1172cc Formula car, but was considered by the race\norganisers as giving an unfair advantage (i.e. “too fast\nto race”!) for the first of several times in Lotus history\n.\nA return to Le Mans in 1957 saw five cars entered.\nThe FPF 1500 should have been a contender on the\nleader board but dropped a valve in practice, which left\nthree FWA 1100’s and a 750cc special ultra short stroke\nFWA. All four cars finished the 24-hour race and the\nspectacle of them crossing the line in formation was a\nmemorable one. Lotus won the prestigious Index of\nPerformance and both the 750 and 1100 classes.\nRecord-breaking with the Eleven continued at\nMonza in 1957, with a Series 2 car using an 1100cc\nsupercharged engine. It was only slightly quicker than\nthe previous year, but of course established World\nRecords in a different class, including; 139.9mph for\n200km, plus a 145.5mph fastest lap. Team Lotus hopes\nwere high when a blown 750cc engine was swapped for\nthe 1100cc unit in the same car, but severe leakage on\nthe pressure side of the supercharger unfortunately\nstopped the car in gaining any more records.\n24"

However, the Type 12 was destined never to\nshow great form and, during 1957, not a single victory was scored from any of the\nfour Team Lotus cars, nor three privately-owned cars.

Considering its F2 roots, the Type 12\nperformed admirably in its ten Grand Prix starts during 1958.\nThe Type 12 was the first ever Lotus single-seater,\ncreated to compete in the newly announced 1957\nInternational Formula 2 regulations for un-supercharged\n1500cc cars. Colin Chapman and Harry Mundy were\nalready at work in 1956 and showed an incomplete\ngreen prototype on the Lotus stand at the 1956 Earls\nCourt Motor Show.\nThe prototype spaceframe chassis for the Type 12\nwas made at the Progress Chassis Company using\naircraft-specification Reynolds radiused square-tube\nbottom rails. Initially the chassis shown at Earls Court\nwas fitted with a de Dion rear end, similar to the Lotus\nEleven, except for its use of one radius arm on each\nside. However, experience soon revealed that the\nhandling was affected appreciably by the changing\nload of the rear-mounted fuel tank.\nAs a result, a new suspension system was devised\nby Colin, called the ‘Chapman Strut’. There were\nessentially three members: the driveshaft, which located\neach wheel laterally\n, a single forward-facing radius arm\nand the strut member (coil-spring and damper). These\nthree converged on into an aluminium casting\ncontaining two wheel bearings. The driveshaft was\nangled up by three degrees to provide slight negative\ncamber. This arrangement benefited both un-sprung\nand overall weight and reduced to a minimum the\ncamber changes caused by fuel loading, making\nhandling predictable.\nAt the front end was a double wishbone set-up\nwith the top wishbone doubling as an anti-roll bar, plus\ncoil-spring/damper units. This set-up had become the\ncharacteristic Lotus independent front end for a whole\ngeneration of Lotus cars.\nNew for 1957 was the Coventry Climax FPF twin\noverhead cam engine, which had been designed for\nMODEL\nType 12\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 2, also run in Formula 1 races\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1957-59\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n12\nENGINE TYPE\nCoventry Climax FPF dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1475-2207cc/142-194bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n131in/60in/35in\nWHEELBASE\n88in\nWEIGHT\n660-770lb/299-349kg\nFormula 2 & 1\nType 12\nFormula 2. This 1475cc unit was extremely powerful\nand – once teething problems of dropped valves and\nfailed pistons had been overcome – very reliable.\nThe five-speed transaxle gearbox was developed by\nRichard Ansdale and Harry Mundy\n, and the propshaft\nwas set so low that it passed under the driver’s seat.\nGear changes were accomplished rather like they were\nin early motorcycles, via a zig-zag gate, which was\nperhaps the car’s major failing (some at Lotus dubbed it\nthe ‘queerbox’). Gears could not be cut quickly enough\nin Britain, so Colin Chapman ordered these from ZF in\nGermany\n, as well as limited-slip differentials. It was the\ndrawbacks of this gearbox, which persuaded Colin that\nhe needed to take on a transmissions development man\n– and that turned out to be Lotus Mark VI owner Keith\nDuckworth, who was hired in 1957.\nFor the bodywork Frank Costin was again called\nin; he was well qualified having designed the successful\nVanwall Grand Prix single-seater. The shape was\ndesigned with minimal frontal area, and the radiator was\ninclined back to reduce the height of the bonnet line.\nIn order to keep un-sprung weight down, a different\ntype of wheel was chosen, namely bolt-on (rather than\nknock-on) magnesium alloy disc wheels. It was\npreferable to keep the thickness of the alloy as thin as\npossible, yet it also needed to be strong, so a web pattern\nwas devised. The bending strength of the wheel varied\nas the folds became deep towards the centre of the hub\nand shallower towards the rims. This arrangement\nalso did away with holes or spokes, a great help in\ncombatting fatigue cracks. At the front the hubs were\nintegral with the wheels and the six-bolt fixings held\nbrake discs on, while at the rear the six bolts actually\nlocated the wheels to the axle. Colin realised that, as\ntyres were unlikely to need to be changed during the\ncourse of a race, the inconvenience of bolt fixings was\nworth the weight reduction they represented over\nknock-off hubs.\nOne final technical point in favour of the now\nchristened ‘wobbly web’ design was that it created\n"

He was helped\nby being able to mould the petrol tanks on early\nproduction cars into the front wings, and to be able\nto incorporate larger doors for improved accessibility.\nAs far as a powerplant was concerned, nothing\nreally matched Colin’s power-to-weight ratio\nexpectations, so he eventually persuaded Leonard Lee\nto build a specially enlarged version of the Coventry\nClimax FWA engine using the block and bore of the\nFWB with the FWA\n’s shorter stroke, producing a\ndisplacement of 1216cc. Known as the FWE, it only\ndeveloped 75bhp – perhaps a little disappointing\nconsidering its quite considerable cost.\nSpace at Tottenham Lane was too tight to\ncontemplate moulding work, so Lotus’ acquisition\nof the premises at Edmonton had provided the ideal\ndevelopment base, as well as the degree of secrecy\nneeded. As for a long-term production site, the\nfacilities at Hornsey and Edmonton were inadequate.\nColin wanted to build a factory of his own in London\nand made a proposal to redevelop the Hornsey site\nusing an extra plot of land alongside, but a ban on\nindustrial development in the capital forced him to\ntake an option on a plot of land at Cheshunt. Until\nthe factory could be built, outside firms would have\nto look after the moulding of the Elite bodyshell.\nColin had wanted the car to be ready in early\n1957, but eventually the non-running prototype was\ncompleted just in time for the October Earls Court\nMotor Show. It received tremendous publicity and\nacclaim. The first running car (chassis 1001, registered\nEL5) was seen on display at the Geneva Motor Show\nin March 1958.\nUp until early 1960, the glass-fibre work was sub-\ncontracted to Maximar Mouldings, a boat builder in\nPulborough in the south of England. The completed\nbody shells were then shipped to the new facility at\nCheshunt for final assembly by Lotus. In September\n1959 Lotus placed a contract with Bristol Aeroplane\nPlastics to commence production of what would\nbecome the Series II Elite body/chassis unit.\nAll Series 1 Elites were built in right-hand-drive\nand featured an independent suspension based on\nthe design Colin had conceived for the single-seater\nType12. At the front the double wishbone system was\nbolted to a front subframe and used a combined\nMilestone Car\ncoil-spring/shock absorber, unit as well as an anti-roll bar. At the rear, the\n‘Chapman Strut’ suspension was utilised, attached to the body at the top using\na hefty rubber/metal bush.\nAlthough intended purely as a road car, Elites inevitably went racing, and good\nfriend of Colin Chapman, Ian Walker kicked things off in May 1958 with a win at\nSilverstone, driving EL5 (seen far left at Snetterton in June). During the 1958 racing\nseason EL5 was just about the most successful production sports car, and Ian Walker\ntook another six outright race victories. Jim Clark battled against Colin Chapman at\nthe 1958 Brands Hatch Boxing Day meeting, and in only his second full season of\nracing, was probably the most successful Elite racer in 1959.\nLotus had three Elite entries at the 1959 Le Mans, with Clark and Whitmore in\nthe works car running as number 42. The best result however was the private entry\nnumber 41 car of Peter Lumsden and Peter Riley [WUU2] which came home in\na splendid eighth overall and first in the 1500cc class.

The chassis-frame was wider\nand lower than the Type 12, and again used Reynolds\nround-edge bottom longerons, and square uprights up\nfront to enable easier suspension mounting. The frame\nwas mainly formed of 20-gauge tubing with some\n18-gauge members, welded together by Progress\nChassis Company. At the rear an unusual rubber sling\nsupported the weight of both the fuel and oil tanks.\nUnlike the Vanwall, the new Type 16 was\nextremely low, achieved by seating the driver on the\nundertray and inclining the Climax FPF engine at\n62 degrees – almost completely on its side – rather like\nin the Type 15. Additionally, it was offset 5½ degrees\nfrom the centre line of the car so that the propshaft\ncould run to the left of the driver. This linked up to\na modified Lotus positive-stop gearbox with a new\ncasing, and required a lateral offset between the\ngearbox input and output shafts. The exhaust was fully\nenclosed by the bodywork to reduce drag, which it did,\nbut there was obviously concern about the fire risk.\nThe bodywork itself was of super light (22-gauge)\naluminium, and in aerodynamic terms the 16 was a\ntriumph. The air intake on the nose was tiny, thanks to\nthe ducted radiator system, and two side ducts in the\nbody, the left one housing alloy pipes to cool the oil,\nthe right one enclosing the exhaust pipe. The familiar\nChapman strut suspension system was used at the rear\n(this time with longer oval-section radius rods), while\nthe front end had the usual Lotus wishbone suspension\nset-up.

Two prototypes were\nfielded in the French Grand Prix meeting at Rheims in\nJuly 1958 but there were problems, mostly resulting\nfrom the awkward engine and transmission layouts.\nTwo weeks later in the British GP at Silverstone,\nGraham Hill had to abandon ship when his backside\nsimply became too hot to continue. After this debacle,\nthere was yet another drive-train experiment with an\ninstallation consisting of a more upright engine, which\nhad a 17-degree cant and a 10-degree offset to the\nright. This then became standard set-up for the 1959\ncars. Having brought the gearbox back into alignment\nwith the drive shafts, this now meant offsetting the\ndriving position and pedals.\nThe horizontal layout was finally abandoned by the\ntime of the German Grand Prix, and Cliff Allison in\nthe only Formula 1 Type 16 looked at one stage as if\nhe might come second before a split radiator forced\nhim back. The best result in 1958 was Hill’s sixth place\nin the Italian GP\n.\nFor 1959 a new feature was incorporated, namely\nan oval steel tube and sheet steel scuttle bulkhead,\ndrilled for lightness, which improved torsional rigidity\nand was the work of new Lotus designer/draughtsman\nLen Terry.

Overall height, and therefore\nfrontal area was reduced by laying the dry-sumped\ntwin-cam Climax engine virtually on its side, just \ndegrees from the horizontal. The double-curvature\nwindscreen was smoothly moulded in one piece, and\na lipped top edge to the screen to help reduce drag\nstill further. The body featured a very smooth\nundertray and hinged front and rear ends, which\ncould be quickly removed, and as before, the\nradiator was fully ducted so that the hot cooling air\ndid not pass back through the engine compartment.\nThe front suspension followed the now familiar\nLotus formula of fabricated wishbones, and braking\nwas also as before – by Girling discs, outboard at\nthe front, inboard at the rear. The most significant\nchange over the Eleven was that the 15 was the first\nsports-racing Lotus to have fully independent rear\nsuspension. This used the Chapman Strut principle\npioneered on the 12 and Elite. The other major\nchange was that Lotus declared itself confident\nthat the bugs had been ironed out of its integral\nfive-speed gearbox and ZF limited-slip\ndifferential unit.\nThe early gearboxes had a notched quadrant stop\nwithin the box, but later a positive-stop change was\nsubstituted, with a separate knob to engage reverse\nprojecting between the seat backs. Because the\ngearbox was rear-mounted there was plenty of space\nfor the pedals, which were wide-spaced. However the\npedalbox itself was of restricted depth, fore and aft,\nand to accommodate the necessary clutch pedal\ntravel, its pivot point was angled so that the foot\npad moved to the right as the pedal was depressed.\nOther changes included the ‘building-in’ of\nthe hitherto detachable head fairing\nand rearranged stowage in\nthe tail. The spare\nwheel was now\nmounted\nvertically on the\nright (extending up\ninto the head fairing),\nwith battery and three\ntanks (for fuel, gearbox and\nengine oil) occupying the\nremaining space.

Amazingly, Hill posted a fifth\nfastest lap in practice – quicker than the 3-litre Ferrari – but the race proved\ndisappointing, both cars retiring relatively quickly. By this time the acute angle\nto which the engines were canted had been reduced to a mere 17 degrees from\nthe vertical for the Le Mans cars, |so long narrow bonnet bulges – covering the\nexhaust cam box, – grew from the LM cars and the first of the Series 2 cars.\nThe Series 2 Type 15 was announced in August 1958, and featured a 1.5-litre\nClimax engine canted at 17 degrees (like the Le Mans cars), plus a BMC four-\nspeed gearbox mounted with the engine, a normal H-pattern gate and a separate\nchassis-mounted final drive unit. A Series 3 version followed in 1959 with the\nsame arrangement but a stiffened chassis, reversed front wishbones, a one-inch\nnarrower front track and a choice of 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5-litre engines."

        "content": "In 1959, following two years in which the Lotus\nEleven was virtually invincible in British 1100cc\nsports car racing, the new Type 17 became its\nlogical development. It was a genuine advance\nin that, as well as being much smaller, it was\n110lb lighter, had a lower frontal area and was\nclaimed to have even better road holding. Lotus\nreports said that tests showed it had improved\nacceleration, and much reduced wheel-spin.\nAs with the Eleven, the Type 17 had a multi-tubular\nspaceframe which was built up from 5/8-inch and\n¾-inch square and round tubing of 20-gauge steel.\nAs before, the propshaft tunnel and floor were stressed\nmembers, forming an integral part of the frame, with\nthe tunnel taking braking and acceleration loads from\nthe chassis mounted differential unit. The engine\n(a choice of the 1100cc Coventry Climax FWA in\n84bhp Stage Three tune, or the 750cc FWM) was\ncarried on two rubber mountings at the front and\non a single rubber mounting, attached to the gearbox,\nat the rear. As on the Eleven it was tilted sideways\nat an angle of 10 degrees to the left to give a straight\ninduction tract. For the first time on a small capacity\nLotus, the transmission was via a hydraulically\noperated clutch. The rear frame now incorporated\na spare wheel mounting and an easily detachable\npetrol tank to provide ready access to the final drive\nunit and rear brakes.\nOne of the most interesting features of the new car\nwas the MacPherson strut-type front suspension, with\neach wheel located by a wide-based lower wishbone.\nThe tubular stub axle, brake caliper mounting plate\nand steering arm were all fixed to the base of the strut\nby means of four bolts, which gave a very strong yet\nlight assembly incorporating the absolute minimum of\ncomponents. This new, simplified, suspension system\nhad been designed to reduce weight, to reduce load\nproblems at mounting points, and to permit further\nrefinement of the chassis-frame, which now weighed\njust under 42lb. It was also designed to allow wheel\nloads to react through movement of the wishbone\nrather than through the complete strut. The\nArmstrong co-axial coil-spring/adjustable damper\nunits at the front were also mounted in an almost\nupright position in order to reduce camber change.\nThe front suspension benefited from a roll centre\nheight of only two inches, compared with six inches\non the swing-axle Eleven. The relatively narrow 3ft\n6in front track was designed to fully accommodate the\nwheels within the bodywork to still allow a reasonable\nturning circle of 39 feet. At the rear, Elite-style fully\nindependent Chapman strut suspension was fitted\nfor the first time on a small-capacity sports racing\ncar. Steering was by a new type of lightweight rack\nand pinion gear.\nThe neat bodywork was designed by Len Terry\nto be aerodynamically efficient (frontal area was just\n9 sq.ft.). It was smaller in all respects than the Eleven\nand incorporated the high tail and the wide curved\nwindscreen first seen at Le Mans in 1957. The spare\nwheel and fuel tank were mounted in the tail. Sadly,\nthe Type 17 was plagued by handling problems and\nwas no match for the Lola-Climax Mk1, which\nbecame the dominant car in its class.\nPrivate owners were disappointed and Team Lotus\nstruggled with its own cars. The first outing of a Type\n17 proved to be typical: Alan Stacey had to withdraw\nat Goodwood on Easter Monday, because of dire\nhandling. However, Stacey defended the 17 against\ncritics who said the car was too narrow, blaming the\nearly difficulties on the increasing sophistication of\nthe car’s design. Much testing followed, especially in\npreparation for the Silverstone International Trophy\nmeeting which resulted in the ride height being\nlowered for the race.\nEventually the handling problem was resolved by\nreplacing the front struts with a conventional wishbone\nlayout. This revision was offered as a retro-fit by Lotus\nwhen the car was next serviced (the customer did have\nto pay, though), ensuring that very few cars still retain\nthe original set-up shown here (right). However, despite\nthis modification, the damage had already been done\nto the Type 17’s reputation. At Le Mans two privately\nowned 750cc engined Type 17s were entered under\nthe Team Lotus banner.

The chosen engine was\nthe latest 2495cc Coventry Climax FPF unit, which\ndeveloped 237bhp, and the Lotus five-speed gearbox/final\ndrive unit affectionately known as ‘The Queerbox’.\nTo cope with the higher speeds and heavier engine,\nbraking on the Formula One car was by means of disc\nbrakes rather than the drums of the Junior, although they\nwere now mounted outboard at the front and inboard at\nthe rear. The wobbly web wheel rims were also modified\nfrom those on the Formula Junior car to carry wider\nDunlop tyres.\nMODEL\nType 18\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula Junior\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1960-61\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n120+\nENGINE TYPE\nCosworth-Ford 105E\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n997cc/75bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n135in/55in/26in exc. roll bar\nWHEELBASE\n90in\nWEIGHT\n770lb/349kg\nThe car had been developed from the drawing\nboard stage in just five weeks and true to its role as a\nmulti-purpose Formula 1/Formula 2/Formula Junior\nmachine, the first appearance of the Type 18 was as\na prototype aluminium-bodied Formula Junior car. It\narrived just in time to be driven in practice for the 1959\nBRSCC Boxing Day meeting at Brands Hatch.\nAlthough very different from the 1959 Lotus 16, the\noverall concept of the Type 18 was still typically Lotus.\nThis included a spaceframe chassis, with the forward\nsection fully triangulated and in itself a complete\nstructure, which carried mountings for the front\nsuspension, pedals, brake and clutch master cylinders\nand steering rack. Forward of this braced section was\na separate, lighter frame carrying the water and oil\nradiators, and oil tanks. The centre of the chassis was\nmarked by a Lotus feature, a fabricated sheet and tube\nscuttle frame which eliminated the need for cross bracing.\nThis formed a convenient and well-supported area to\nmount the instruments, steering column, gear lever, and\nother switchgear.\nThe central part of the chassis, braced on three sides\nonly but drawing torsional rigidity from the structures\naround it, connected the scuttle hoop to the engine\nbulkhead. The rear chassis had an easily removable\nY-shaped diagonal section which braced the engine bay.\nThe front suspension was by unequal length double\nwishbones, with the latest modifications of a separate\nanti-roll bar, and easily adjustable camber angle. There\nwas insufficient height at the rear to install the familiar\nstrut suspension, so Colin designed an entirely new\n‘double transverse link’ arrangement, formed by the lower\ntubular links and the un-splined driveshafts. Parallel radius\narms ran rearward from the engine bulkhead to the\nbottom and centre of the upright.\nFollowing the lead set by Cooper, the obvious answer was to put the engine behind the\ndriver, whose size would then dictate frontal area of the car. The rear-engined layout\nhad been well proven and Colin felt sure he could improve on what he considered their\nrudimentary suspension designs.\nColin always said he regarded the Type 18 as the first true Formula 1 car he had\ndesigned and built, his previous front-engined efforts being merely dabbling, or restricted\nto use in Formula 2.\nFormula 1\nType 18\nThe body shape was dictated by the square chassis\nand was described by one journalist as “an extremely ugly,\ntank-like body” and he hoped it would be only temporary!\nThe increased drag coefficient of the flat sides, it was\nreasoned, would be cancelled out by the reduction in\nfrontal area.\nBrakes at both the front and rear were 9x1¾-inch\noutboard Lockheed systems fitted with finned aluminium\nAlfin drums to help give better cooling.\nFor Team Lotus the 1960 season would prove to be\nincredibly successful, their three new drivers Jim Clark,\nTrevor Taylor and Peter Arundell won almost every race\nthey entered and the new Lotus Type 18 won just about\nevery major Formula Junior race in the UK that year.\nIn 1959, Lotus was still expanding and had taken\non numerous other commitments. The previous\nyear’s racing results had been poor, so Chapman\ndecided that for 1960 a basic, simple and easily\nmaintained design was called for, rather than a\ntechnically superior but more complicated one.\nWith simplicity in mind, the essentials were to\nminimise power losses, reduce frontal area and\nkeep the centre of gravity as low as possible.\nFormula Junior\nType 18\nThesixties\n“The Sixties saw Colin Chapman’s persistent combination of\ndedication, design skill and astute commercialism, bring Lotus from\nthe ranks of specialist constructor, to major British manufacturer.”\n1960-69"

        "content": "Although, just like Maximar, Bristol experienced initial\nmanufacturing problems, Colin Chapman realised that\ntheir aircraft-bred manufacturing standards would\nyield the highest possible quality. Bristol saw\nproduction of the Elite as the ideal exploitation of\ntheir extensive expertise in glass reinforced plastic\nmanufacture, in both aesthetics and construction. The\nBristol plant built the chassis body units from a new set\nof moulds supplied by Lotus, and technicians worked\nhard to make the finish of the moulds as flawless as\npossible, in the hope that the resulting panels would\nbe free of surface irregularities.\nThe first of these revised Series 2 Elite bodyshells\nwere delivered to Cheshunt in July 1960 and Bristol\nwould continue to supply chassis body units until the\nSeries 2 ceased production in the autumn of 1963.\nWith their much improved methods of working, these\nnew shells showed a genuine improvement over the old\nMaximar units until complacency set in and workers at\nthe Bristol plant began to ‘cut corners’, quite literally\nand the quality of production dipped dramatically.\nBristol was embarrassed and immediately rectified\nthe problems that were occurring and took much\ngreater care in the troublesome differential and radius\nmounting area. From then on all shells produced\nwould bear two small depressions on the underbody\nbetween the silencer recesses, which became known\nas ‘double dimples’ and would signify the new better\nbuilt monocoque structures.\nThe other major significant changes between\nthe Series 1 and Series 2 versions of the Elite were\nof course in the suspension area.

Longer softer springs, combined with new\nshock absorbers, gave a softer overall spring rate\ncompared to the Series 1. A slightly changed lower\nwishbone which had a more easily serviceable\ntrunnion was also adopted.\nFor the rear end, again fitting longer softer springs\nand firmer dampers reduced the harshness of the ride\nbut kept the race-track handling. The most significant\nchange however, was the adoption of a completely\nnew design of triangulated wishbone, rather than the\ntroublesome dog-legged version of the Series 1. With\nthe rear end now bolted firmly through the bottom of\nthe hub carrier, this new system with revised geometry\nfurther isolated chassis loads and virtually eliminated\nthe rear wheel tracking problems of the earlier cars.\nAnother new model in the Elite range arrived at\nthe 1960 Motor Show, when a new Special Equipment\nmodel was introduced with uprated carburation and a\ntuned exhaust, producing 83bhp. A close-ratio gearbox\ngave it a speed of 16.15mph per 1000rpm, and there\nwere also better headlamps, a heavy-duty battery and\na heater as standard. Subsequent versions of the SE\nengine would go on to develop over 100bhp. All SE\nmodels were specified by Lotus, regardless of body\ncolour, to have silver roofs (below).\nIn 1960, no fewer than four Elites were entered\nat the Le Mans 24-hour race. Two finished the race,\ncoming first and second in the 1300cc class and first\nand second in the Thermal Efficiency Index.\nBy 1962 production costs had spiralled on the\ncomplicated and slow to build Elite and, in 1963,\nit was ultimately superseded by the separate-chassis\nType 26 Elan.\nElite Series 2\nType 14\nIn September 1959 Lotus placed a contract with\nBristol Aeroplane Plastics in Filton to commence\nproduction of what would become the Series II Elite\nbody/chassis unit at the rate of fifteen per week."

        "content": "The Lotus Seven Series One with its double-curvature\naluminium body panels had been a highly labour\nintensive and expensive car to produce. In fact it is said\nthat little, if any\n, profit was made on the 243 cars produced.\nAs early as late 1959, work began on designing a more\ncost effective model. There were indeed several ways that\nthis was achieved.\nChassis members were reduced in number; flooring to\nthe engine bay and rear axle areas was omitted; steering\ngeometry was simplified including use of a straight\ncolumn; a very favourable deal for the supply of rear axles\nfrom the Standard 10 was struck with the manufacturers,\nwhich now meant the same natural studcentres to all\nwheels without the need for adapting hubs; cheaper\n13-inch diameter Triumph Herald wheels were sourced\nfrom Standard Triumph; rear axle location was simplified\nby the use of an upper trailing arm to each end and\na single lower ‘\nA\n’ bracket connected to the centre, under\nthe differential, which also gave lateral support; the\nexpensive aluminium nose and front and rear wings were\nreplaced with coloured gel coat glassfibre parts which\nremoved the need for painting. All in all the same product\nwas made with a considerable cost saving.\nWhen it arrived in June 1960, the Seven S2 came in\nbare aluminium except for the gel coat coloured glassfibre\nnosecone and wings. There was now a choice of front\nwing styles: either ‘clamshell’ type as already seen on the\nLotus Seven ‘\nAmerica’ (above), or re-styled fixed cycle\nwings (right) which, as before, did not turn with the front\nwheels. The new nosecone was re-designed by John\nFrayling for moulding in GRP rather than Aluminium.\nMODEL\nMark 7\nNAME/FORMULA\nSeven S2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1960-68\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nApprox. 1310\nENGINE TYPE\nFord 100E, 105E or BMC A-Series\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n948-1172cc/35-65bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n132in/58.5in/43in with hood\nWHEELBASE\n88in\nWEIGHT\n952-1036lb/432-470kg\nImprovements over the previous model included\nwindscreen wipers operated via a motor fitted under the\nscuttle and the (replacing the prior overhead arrangement)\nand the hood now became standard equipment.

There was still no\ntachometer and no radiator cooling fan.\nJust two engines were to be offered at the start of S2\nproduction; the Coventry Climax unit was no longer an\noption, as it was said it would not fit the new chassis. They\nwere the old Ford 100E side-valve unit and its associated\n3-speed gearbox with their 1930’s technology still popular\nmainly because of the 750Motor Club 1172cc Formula\nrace series, and the BMC ‘\nA\n’ Series engine from the Austin\nHealey Sprite with its 4-speed gearbox which was proving\nso popular in the U.S.A.\nBy the beginning of 1961, the Ford 105E unit from\nthe Anglia was at last factory fitted in the Seven, having\nbeen a dealer option that Caterham Cars had been\noffering for about a year. This engine with its over-square\ncylinder design was a much needed improvement for the\nSeven as it revved better than the long-stroke BMC unit.\nThe 4-speed Anglia gearbox, although better than Ford’s\nprevious product, was heavier than the BMC version\nand also lacked a remote change. This was overcome by\nmating a Triumph Herald remote to the Ford gearbox via\na specially cast Lotus ‘sandwich’ plate. This new engine\noption mercifully superseded the old side-valve unit from\nthe Ford 100E which had served the car until now.\nSeries 2\nSeven\n"

The suspension again followed the\npractice of the 18, with identical track and wheelbase sizes,\nalthough the front and rear anti-roll bars were of a different\nsize, as were the rear radius arms. The wider front end also\nmeant that the top wishbone and suspension unit could not\nbe mounted by a common bolt and a short tube was placed\nbetween the top wishbone mountings. Other carry-overs\nfrom the F1 car were the steering and brakes, although after\nthe very first prototype car had been built and tested by\nInnes Ireland (left) the rear discs were mounted outboard\nfor better cooling.\nThe enveloping bodywork was made mostly of\nglassfibre, with some aluminium on the lower side panels,\nand it incorporated a detachable GRP nose section and\nengine cover. The battery\n, oil cooler and radiator were\nlocated in the nose. Only the engine oil was circulated to\nthe front though, the gearbox oil being cooled in a separate\nsystem at the rear. The regulation spare wheel was sited\nat the front, above the driver’s knees.\nOnce again the engine was the 2.5-litre Climax FPF\nunit in full Formula 1 tune, although for sports car use it\nhad a starter motor fitted, as well as Lucas coil ignition and\na generator. Two huge twin-chokeWeber 58 DCOE\ncarburettors were fed by twin SU electric fuel pumps.\nThe compact Lotus five-speed gearbox was retained, and\nalthough it did not boast an enviable reliability record, it\ndid have the advantage that the ratios could be changed\nin minutes by removing the gearbox cover and sliding the\ngears out. There was a large cooling vent at the rear on\neach side of the bodywork to keep thetransmission cool.\nWhile recuperating from his F1 crash at Spa, Stirling\nMoss took time off to sample the new Type 19, his first\ndrive since the accident. Soon he was right in the swing of\ntesting and beating the then current Silverstone sports car\nlap record. Moss first raced a Type 19 in August 1960, at\nKarlskoga in Sweden, where he won. While the car was in\nSweden, Jo Bonnier borrowed it and broke the Swedish\nrecord for the flying kilometre at 157.5mph.\nLotus announced that their Components division would\nmake a mere twelve cars for the forthcoming 1961 season,\nsix for sale in Britain and six abroad. In fact, three cars were\npurchased by the British UDT Laystall team for Moss,\nHenry Taylor and Cliff Allison who had considerable\nsuccess in Europe running in the team’s pale green colours,\nwhile the remainder went to America. Officially a total of\njust seventeen Type 19s were built. The meager production\nnumbers had as much to do with the shortage of FPF\nengines as anything, and some of the later examples built\nwere fitted with the larger 2.7-litre Climax FPF engine.\nIn America, Dan Gurney was frequently entered by\nthe Arciero brothers in their appropriate Italian red liveried\nType 19 (below), and he impressed at Riverside in October\n1961 by easily establishing a new lap record. Other cars\nmay have been faster down the back straight but nothing\ncould remotely approach the Type 19 around the corners.\nGurney commented: “It was no particular driving feat.\nIt was just the car.” His most memorable win was in the\n1962 Daytona Continental Three Hours Road Race,\nwhen the engine’s crankshaft failed on the final lap and,\nwith a substantial lead Gurney managed to complete the\nrace using only the starter motor for propulsion.\nIn the USA, several Type 19s were re-engined using\nlarger capacity American powerplants, and late in 1963,\na one-off car called the 19B was constructed by the Lotus\nworks in the UK. This, the final Type 19 built, was\ncommissioned by John Klug, founder of Pacesetter Homes\nRacing, for Dan Gurney to drive. Fitted with a small-block\nFord V8 engine, which necessitated the use of modified\nand strengthened suspension. The 19B was delivered in\nOctober of 1963, and campaigned as the Pacesetter Ford,\nduring 1963 and 1964, with little success however.\nMODEL\nType 19\nNAME/FORMULA\nSports Racer\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1960-62\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n14 +1 (19B)\nENGINE TYPE\nCoventry Climax FPF\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2495cc/237bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n141in/65in/32in\nWHEELBASE\n88in\nWEIGHT\n1232lb/559kg\n1960\nWhile the Type15 had been reasonably successful\nin sports car racing, it had never made Lotus any\nmoney.

In September 1962 the solution\ncame in the form of the new Ford 5-bearing 116E\nCortina engine. This was fitted in the Seven in two guises:\na new model dubbed the ‘Super Seven 1500’ which had\nan unmodified engine with a single side-draught twin-\nchoke Weber 40DCOE2 carburettor on a special Lotus\ncast alloy inlet manifold and the replacement model now\ncalled the ‘Super Seven 1500 Cosworth’ whose engine as\nbefore had a worked head, special camshaft and exhaust\nmanifold, and pair of side’draught twin-choke Weber\ncarburettors.

Two of the longitudinal frame members were now employed to carry\nengine coolant to and from the front-mounted radiator, thus effecting a further saving of\nspace. The Y-shaped member at the rear, running over the top of the gearbox and to the\nright of the engine (and acting as a mounting point for the former) was removable to\nallow the power and transmission units to be fitted more easily.\nThe suspension layout was basically unaltered: at the front, twin unequal length\nwishbones and coil spring damper units with an anti-roll bar mounted on the chassis\nbehind the upper wishbone; at the rear, un-splined axle shafts formed part of the top half\nof what was effectively a wide-based double wishbone layout. The top trailing arm of the\nwishbone now met the hub carrier at the same height as the axle shaft thus improving\nsuspension geometry. Wheel size was reduced at the front from 15 to 13-inches and there\nwere only four stiffening webs, not six as on the rear wheels. Triumph Herald uprights\nand four-bolt hubs were now used, necessitating this change.\nThe twin leading shoe drum brakes also came from the Herald, the Triumph’s front\nassemblies being used all round. Since the Type 18 was found to be over-braked, 8-inch\ndrums were adopted (which saved some space) while the rear brakes were inboard to\nreduce un-sprung weight. Later 20s (20B) were offered with the expensive option of disc\nbrakes. In place of the Junior 18’s Renault sourced three speed, the gearbox choice on\nall but the very first few Type 20s became an inverted Volkswagen-derived unit from\nHewland, with four easily changed, ratios.\nside fuel tanks being available too). Another cockpit\nchange was the relocation of the gear lever to the right-\nhand instead of the left-hand side.\nThe bodywork was made entirely of glassfibre by\nWilliams & Pritchard and its shape was more rounded\nthan before, enclosing the carburettor air intake which\nwas fed by a scoop located aft of the windscreen. All\nthe bodywork was held in place by spring fasteners\nwhich made for quick removal.\nThe sleek new Type 20 debuted at the 1961 Racing\nCar Show, and the Team Lotus works cars made an\nimmediate impression on the track, drivers Trevor\nTaylor and Peter Arundell enjoying great success.\nTaylor took eight victories and Arundell seven (including\nthe prestigious Prix Monaco Junior). Privateer Jo Siffert\nalso won seven races in his Type 20.\nFormula Junior\nType 20\n1961\nFor the 1961 season, the Type 20 took over the\nFormula Junior aspects of the Type 18’s design.\nThe 20 was no longer directly adaptable to F1 or F2\nracing, as the 18 had been. It packed virtually the\nsame components into an even smaller car which\nwas more aerodynamic than the square-cut 18,\nand more typical of the then-current Junior style.\nBy using a special camshaft, twin Weber carburettors\nand a special centre main bearing cap, Cosworth\nEngineering managed to extract impressive and reliable\noutputs from the Ford 105E, 997cc OHV engine. At the\nbeginning of the season, works engines were developing\naround 85bhp. Later in the season, a linered-down\n1100cc version of the 1340cc, 109E Classic engine was\nsubstituted, which could be made to develop just over\n100bhp. The engine was mounted lower in the frame\nthan on the Type 18 (seen below behind the Type 20)\nand the same principle was applied to the driver, who was\nnow seated in a far more reclined position.

None could quite\nbelieve that it would actually go ahead with a limit which\nequated to what had been Formula 2 specification the\nprevious year\nThe main British engine supplier to Formula 1,\nCoventry Climax, was unprepared for the move and so\nthe major teams (Lotus, Cooper and even BRM) were\nforced to rely on the outdated four-cylinder FPF engine.\nFerrari, by contrast, had been working on a new and far\nsuperior V6 power unit for some time.\nCoventry Climax hastily decided to develop a new V8\nengine and issued installation drawings to the main teams.\nThe eventual FWMV engine was in fact deeper and\nlonger than planned, forcing chassis redesigns for those\nteams which had intentions to use the unit.\nFor 1961, this particular problem did not affect Lotus.\nColin Chapman’s personal relationship with Coventry\nClimax’s Leonard Lee was at an all-time low following\nrows over the quality of the FWE engines being supplied\nfor the Elite road car. Although he designed the Type 21\nto use the projected new V8 engine, Chapman rightly\nguessed that Lotus would be last in the queue for the V8\nand so proceeded to make the best of the situation with\nthe old FPF unit.\nThe Type 21 was the new Lotus F1 car for 1961.\nExternally it resembled the Type 20 (Formula Junior car),\nbut under the skin there were several important\ndifferences. The troublesome Lotus gearbox (with its one\ntiny set of dog rings to pick up every gear) was abandoned\nin favour of a ZF gearbox, which the German company\nmade exclusively for Team Lotus, in four and five-speed\nforms. Chapman had ordered it with the V8 engine in\nmind but it worked just as well with the four-cylinder\nengine. Because it had a more increased centre-line\noffset than the Lotus gearbox, a suspension redesign\nwas needed.\nMODEL\nType 21\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1961-62\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n11\nENGINE TYPE\nCoventry Climax FPF\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1495cc/155bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n141in/60in/28in\nWHEELBASE\n89in\nWEIGHT\n990lb/449kg\nWhile the principle of the pierced-bulkhead\nspaceframe with its engine bay Y-frame was familiar\nenough from the Type 18, the front suspension was\nradically different, featuring inboard coil-spring/damper\nunits held in compression by an extension of the upper\nwishbone. The top wishbone was made of stainless steel\nand pivoted on a spindle which carried the entire front\nsuspension load (a cross-brace was welded into the frame\nat an early stage to compensate). The inboard system\nalleviated a lot of drag and allowed for a lighter anti-roll\nbar. With much reduced power outputs in Formula 1,\naerodynamics began to play a far greater role in ultimate\nsuccess on the track, and the inboard system with its\nrelatively clear airflow between wheels and body would\nbe widely adopted by other constructors in coming years.\nAt the rear, the driveshafts were no longer used as\nmain lateral location devices, being simply required to\ntransmit power to the wheels. Instead, lower wishbones\nand new upper links provided lateral location, the latter\nattached to an extension of the aluminium hub carrier.\nThis layout maintained negative camber geometry and\nparallel radius arms provided fore-and-aft location, as\nbefore. Colin employed a Metalastik rubber doughnut\nas an inboard universal joint at the rear, an approach he\nfavoured over sliding splined driveshafts which he felt\ncould bind under high power loading and inhibit\nsuspension movement. They also had the effect of\ncushioning the drive-train and reduced the alteration of\ntraction between tyre and road during gear changes. The\nrear brakes were outboard to improve cooling and the\ncalipers now gripped the trailing edges of the discs, whilst\n15-inch wheels were specified both front and rear.\nThe cockpit was extremely tight (oil and water passed\nthrough the frame tubes) and following the lead of the\nType 20, the driver was expected to lean back to reduce\nfrontal area. Compared to the Type 18, the new Type 21\nwas some 50lb heavier, conforming to the new F1\nminimum weight limit of 450kg (990lb).\nFormula 1\nType 21\nThe prototype Type 21 was built from scratch in six weeks, just missing the Aintree\n200 meeting, but was out testing two days later at Silverstone. The 21’s first race\nwas the Monaco Grand Prix in May 1961. Two complete cars were shipped out and\nJimmy Clark went fastest in practice, but he crashed heavily and the car had to be\nrepaired using parts from a third component-form car. Innes Ireland wrote off his car by\nchanging into second instead of fourth under full power with the new ZF gearbox.

It was enough to secure\nrunners-up position for Lotus in the 1961 Constructors’ Championship, behind the more\npowerful Ferrari, but it could not save Ireland’s place at Team Lotus for the forthcoming\n1962 season, when Trevor Taylor was brought in alongside Clark as number two driver.\n05.24.22\ncheque\n05.24.22\ncheque"

This also had the effect of\nproviding a better induction tract to an engine that was\nguaranteed by Cosworth to deliver 100bhp at 7500rpm.\nAutosport magazine enthused about the ‘absolutely\nstaggering’ flexibility of the engine and the Type 22’s\n‘phenomenally high’ cornering ability. It also remarked\non the severely inclined driving position, noting that the\ncircuit became more difficult to see clearly.\nThe 22’s official debut was the January 1962 Racing\nCar Show, where Lotus Components displayed its new\nJunior contender. With the Ford-Cosworth engine fitted,\nthe cost was £1550. Despite the fact that there was now\nserious competition from Brabham and it cost £100\nmore than the Type 20, it proved popular, and sold well.\nFormula Junior as a racing series was now a global\nphenomenon and was proving immensely popular in\nplaces as far afield as South America and Australia.\nTeam Lotus works driver Peter Arundell scored a\nremarkable 18 victories out of 25 starts during the 1962\nseason, including the high-profile Formula Junior Monaco\nGrand Prix warm-up race. This remains a record for the\nhighest number of wins in one season by one car in any\nFIA sanctioned international race series. It also follows\nthat his car for the season, chassis number 22-FJ-02 is\nprobably the most successful Lotus ever, in terms of\npure race results.\nThe Type 22’s spaceframe was much stiffer than before\nthanks to thicker gauge metal, a double-skinned bulkhead\nand many detail alterations imparting extra rigidity. Jack\nFairman in Motor Racing magazine commented: “I’m\nsure most people will be really pleased to hear that Colin\nChapman has put the extra weight into the frame..... As\nColin put it to me, ‘\nAn over-exuberant type can give the\nGoodwood chicane a hearty clout with this one and still\ncarry on motor racing.’”\nFollowing their homologation on the Triumph Herald,\nGirling disc brakes were standardised front and rear. The\ndiscs were mounted outboard and provided much better\nbraking than on the 20, which had become under-braked\nin the fastest examples. The front suspension remained\nmuch as before, but the rear end followed the practice of\nthe Type 21 in that the driveshafts were not used as the\nupper location point for the suspension. There were\ninboard rubber doughnuts and cast aluminium hub\ncarriers extending above the wheel centre-line to act as\nattachments for a single transverse link mounted at\nroughly the same height as the upper suspension\nmounting. There were separate anti-roll bars at both ends\nand the track was slightly wider than on the Type 20.\nFollowing experiments on Trevor Taylor’s 20, and in the\nlight of Dunlop’s decision to market 5.50 section tyres,\n13-inch wheels were now specified all round.\nMotive power was provided by the new 1100cc Ford-\nCosworth Mk IV engine.

As journalist John\nBlunsden commented at the time: “It is a car\nwhich, design-wise, offers few if any surprises.\nThe Lotus 23 is the closest thing to the 22 Junior\nthat it is possible to make that will carry a scaled\ndown and smoothed out Appendix C, Monte\nCarlo style body.”\nThe familiar spaceframe was splayed out to\ncarry the wider bodywork, and torsional stiffness\nbenefitted substantially from the increased cross-\nsectional area. The floorpan was of 20-gauge\naluminium sheet. The prototype had a large\nwedge-shaped fuel tank fitted behind the seats but\nproduction cars had a longitudinal nine-gallon\ntank mounted amidships to the left of the\npassenger seat; an additional tank could be\nplaced in the right-hand sill if long distance\nracing was intended. The front suspension\nfollowed that of the Type 19, except for the\nTriumph Herald hubs which the Type 22 also\nused. Likewise, the rear suspension was identical\nto the 22, except for slightly harder damper\nsettings and slightly stiffer springs.\nThe elegant, close-fitting bodywork was\nmade entirely of colour-impregnated glassfibre,\nincorporating an air intake duct, fore of the\nradiator. The chassis tubes again carried oil and\nwater between the engine and their respective\ncooling radiators. The centre bodywork sections\nwere attached securely to the frame; but the rest\nof the body comprised large front and rear\nsections which hinged on outriggers and were\nheld closed by simple spring clips. The doors\nwere hinged at their bottom edge and blended\nwith the three-piece wraparound screen.\nThe Type 23 was introduced at the 1962 Racing\nCar Show with Ford 109E power, as modified by\nCosworth to produce over 100bhp at 7400rpm\nfrom 1097cc. The engine was mounted on the car’s\ncentre-line, but unlike the 22, it was mounted\nvertically in the frame. The gearshift linkage\nto the Renault or VW gearbox could best be\ndescribed as circuitous; it had to be cranked\nover to the left of the engine via two universal\njoints and three guides. The VW gearbox had\na conventional gate but the Renault box had first\nand second gears nearer the driver of a right-hand\ndrive car. A Hewland five-speed box was also listed as an option.\nAt Le Mans in 1962, the two 23s entered (with 997cc and 745cc engines)\nwere rejected in scrutineering because the rear wheels had six-stud fixings\nwhile the front wheels had only four studs (rules required that the spare\nwheel should fit both front and rear). Colin modified the rears to take four\nstuds but the race officials refused to look at them, commenting that if six\nstuds had been required to hold the wheel on before, how could four studs\nnow be strong enough?” Despite intervention by the RAC, the exclusion\nstood, a clear case of discrimination in favour of the domestic teams which\nmight have been challenged by Lotus in the Index of Performance. Following\nthis fiasco, Colin Chapman vowed he would never race at Le Mans again,\nand he never did.\nWhile some Type 23s were also built with the smaller 997cc engine, as\nused in the Le Mans entry, a more exciting choice was in store. During early\n1962 Lotus was developing its new Twin-cam engine for the Elan and it\nlooked ideal for use in the Type 23.\nSports Racer\nType 23\n"

This would be the first they\nproduced in quantity for Lotus, replacing The Progress\nChassis Co. which made just one Type 24. For some\ntime, Triumph uprights had been used in Lotus front\nsuspension; but now that changed. Brand new front\nupright castings were mated up to a new high-mounted\nrack-and-pinion steering mechanism. The track rod\nwas now raised up to a level with the top rocker arm,\nwhich had the effect of cleaning up the airflow over\nthe front suspension.\nAt the rear of the car, the system of rubber doughnuts\non the inboard ends of the driveshafts made a comeback.\nSplined driveshafts had been used on the Type 21 towards\nthe end of its life but Chapman still felt they\nwere inferior.\nThe Coventry Climax FWMV V8 engine was now\nin full production and in high demand from Lotus,\nCooper, Brabham and Lola, as well as customer car\nteams. The Type 24 was designed specifically around this\nengine. Obviously it consumed more fuel than the old\nfour cylinder FPF\n, and the additional required fuel\ncarrying capacity was achieved by siting an extra tank\nonce again above the driver’s legs, supplementing the\nside-mounted tanks held in place by straps.\nColin Chapman’s policy was to make the Type 24\nchassis available to existing customers only\n, so a maximum\nof 15 cars would be built.

Trevor Taylor\nalso raced a Type 24 but with a four-cylinder Climax\nengine; he retired while in sixth place. Clark also achieved\npole position at the Pau Grand Prix and was leading until\ngear selection problems forced him out. He then went\non to win the Aintree ‘200’.

Another team using Type 24s\nwas the Swiss team, Scuderia Filipinetti, with Jo Siffert winning at Syracuse in his BRM\npowered car.\nOverall, the Type 24 was undoubtedly overshadowed by Lotus’ simultaneous\n(and secret) development of the monocoque Type 25, and certainly customers for the\nType 24 must have felt short-changed when the new Type 25 was wheeled out at the first\ninternational GP event of 1962 at Zandvoort. It was at this event, however, where Trevor\nTaylor scored the best result for the Type 24, namely second place behind Graham Hill\nin his BRM P57.

        "content": "Colin Chapman said that the inspiration for the\ndesign came from the steel backbone frame of\nthe new Lotus Elan sports car, the impressive\nstiffness of this chassis giving him the idea that it\ncould be used on a single-seater. His scheme was\nto space the sides of the backbone far enough\napart for a driver to sit between them.\nIt was all hatched at a lunchtime meeting\nwith Mike Costin, when Chapman simply began\nsketching on a paper napkin. Straight after, he\nwent home and drew up the general arrangement\nscheme of the first modern monocoque in\nFormula 1. He famously said afterwards: “Despite\npeople telling me ever since that there were\nmonocoque racing cars in 1911 or whenever, the\nType 25 was the first as far as I was concerned –\nI had never seen one before, and we didn’t know\nif it would work.”\nThe monocoque chassis was made from\n16swg aluminium sheet, the side members being\nlong boxes containing the flexible fuel tanks and\nacting as the lower body half. All this was\npainstakingly riveted up in a jig, a rather\nlaborious process. These boxes ended directly\nbehind the cockpit, but two smaller boxes were\nriveted on behind to contain the engine (the\nClimax V8), which was directly bolted in place to\ncontribute to chassis rigidity. The chassis finished\nat the rear with a square section hoop to which\nthe rear suspension arms were bolted. Triangular\nchannels in the frame’s underside carried oil,\nwater, and hydraulic and electrical systems.\nWith a monocoque tub, less space was wasted,\nand the Type 25 boasted the slimmest body ever\nseen in GP racing. No formal aerodynamic tests\nwere carried out but the simple principle of\nkeeping the bodywork as tight as possible over the\ncomponents minimised frontal area and reduced\ndrag. The car was tailored to Jim Clark, who lay\nas near to horizontal as possible, and in fact\ncouldn’t see the road directly in front of the car.\nThe suspension of the Lotus 25 differed little\nfrom that of the Type 24, the front suspension\nhaving the welded-up cantilever top arm which\noperated the coil-spring/damper unit inside the\nbodywork (cooled by ducts flanking the radiator)\n1962\nIt is no overstatement to say that the Lotus Type\n25 revolutionised Formula 1 design. It was\na complete break from conventional thinking,\nadvanced even for Colin Chapman, and its\ndevelopment was one of the best kept secrets\nin motor racing. The major revolution was to\nabandon the traditional tubular spaceframe in\nfavour of an aircraft-style monocoque (literally\nmeaning ‘single-shell’).\nand twin lower wishbones. Tubular stub axles\nwere fitted, and the steering box was mounted\nhigh on the chassis, level with the top suspension\narm. The rear suspension had lower wishbones\nwith a single inboard mounting point, a single\nupper arm and twin radius rods, together with an\nanti-roll bar. The driveshafts had inboard rubber\nuniversal joints. Compared to the Type 21, the\ntrack was slightly narrower and the roll centres\nlower, calling for stiffer anti-roll bars and\nsofter springing.\nThe engine was the Coventry Climax V8,\nthe lack of chassis tubes and unnecessary\nclutter making this especially accessible for\nmaintenance work and removal: it was merely\nnecessary to remove the top half of the body to\nlay the chassis bare. Lotus was the only team to\nuse the German ZF five-speed gearbox in 1962.\nIn a concealed corner of the Team Lotus\nworkshops at Cheshunt, the Type 25 was secretly\nprepared by Dick Scammell, Ted Woodley, Mike\nCostin and Colin Chapman. Its first appearance\nwas at the Dutch Grand Prix in 1962, the first\nevent of the World Championship series. Once\nit had been accepted by the scrutineers, it\nwould begin a remarkable career. Despite a\ndisappointing ninth place at Zandvoort, it was\nclearly more than competitive from the very\nstart, and quickly established its credentials\nas the fastest car in Formula 1.\nClark was the number one driver,\naccompanied by Trevor Taylor. In its first year,\nand in the hands of Jim Clark, it won the World\nChampionship events at Belgium, Britain,\nUnited States and Mexico, and also won non-\nchampionship F1 races at Oulton Park and at the\nRand GP\n. Taylor had a poor year but did win the\nNatal GP\n. Three mechanical failures robbed Team\nLotus of the constructors’ title by just one point,\nand Clark came second overall to Graham Hill\nin the drivers’ World Championship, who was\nracing for the BRM Owen Racing Organisation.\nIn 1963, changes to the car included fuel\ninjection, lighter gauge monocoques and nose\ncone side ducts.

As such, the Elan became more\nup-market. Overall its design had less of the\nElite’s uncompromised feel and far more regard\nfor production viability and costings.\nThe simple, deep backbone chassis was made\nof 18swg steel with local 16swg stiffening, and\nweighed a mere 75lb. The central box section\nmeasured 11½-inches by 6-inches and served\nas the propshaft tunnel while each end of the\nchassis forked out into narrower sections. Cross-\nmembers and turrets at the front cradled the\nengine, gearbox, steering and suspension, and the\nrear housed the final drive and suspension. The\nsuspension consisted of pressed steel wishbones\nwith coil-spring/damper units at the front and,\nat the rear, a wide-based lower wishbone and\ncoil-spring/damper unit set-up; the lower end of\nthe strut fixed in a cast aluminium housing which\ncontained the wheel bearings and hubs, as well as\nlugs for mounting the Girling disc brakes. These\nwere mounted in a semi inboard position at the\nrear, near to the Rotoflex rubber couplings.\nThe body, designed by Ron Hickman, was\nmoulded in two main glassfibre sections\n(floorpan/arches and upper body) which were then\nbonded together. Steel strengthening for the door\njambs made it sufficiently rigid to not have to\nrely totally on the chassis for its strength. Clean\naerodynamics favoured a pop-up headlamp\narrangement, which was worked by two vacuum\ncylinders. The front and rear bumpers were made\nof plastic and filled with polyurethane foam.\nWith very little frontal area to work with Colin\nChapman again used his ingenious method for\nthe placement of a number plate at the front.

The Elite lost Lotus money and\nthere had to be a better way. Colin Chapman\nsaw it in the backbone chassis, which would\nbecome a Lotus hallmark for years to come.\nThe backbone chassis concept made its\nroadcar debut in the Type 26 Elan, a model\nwhich was crucial to the future of Lotus.\n1962\nperfectly legal airflow number plate!\nChapman wanted a twin overhead camshaft\nengine for the Elan and turned to Harry Mundy\nof The Autocar magazine. Mundy, formerly with\nBRM and Coventry Climax agreed to develop\na double, overhead-cam cylinder-head.\nPreliminary work was on the 3-bearing 109E\nblock, until the Ford 116E 5-bearing block became\navailable. The alloy heads were initially made by\nJ.A. Prestwich, and then later on by Lotus itself.\nAs announced, the Elan engine displaced\n1498cc and was basically a detuned version of\nthe same unit that had powered the Lotus 23\nfamously driven by Jim Clark to near success at\nthe Nürburgring earlier in the season. The head,\npushrods, timing cover and water pump of the\noriginal OHV engine were discarded and Lotus\nfitted the Mundy designed, aluminium DOHC\nhead. However the 100bhp engine was quickly\nsuperseded by the definitive 1558cc, 105bhp\nversion, with twin-Weber carburettors. Almost\nall (probably 15 of the 22) examples of 1.5-litre\nElans were subsequently recalled and converted\nto 1558cc spec.\nThe four-speed gearbox was derived directly\nfrom the Ford Classic, though the final drive ratio\n(in Lotus’ own aluminium casing) was 3.90 instead\nof 4.125.

In place of\naluminium bodywork, which was time-consuming and\nexpensive to manufacture, it would have a glassfibre\nsections. The monocoque chassis was made of 18swg\naluminium sheet with a sheet steel front bulkhead\nencasing the front suspension, an aluminium sheet centre\nbulkhead (plus a humped seat pan which added some\nextra rigidity) and a third bulkhead (in sheet steel) at the\nrear which was completed by a tie-bar. This was all\nclothed in ¼-inch thick glassfibre body panels which were\n(firmly!) pop-riveted in place.\nThe Lotus 25 inspired front suspension utilised\nfabricated upper rocking arms, wide-based lower\nwishbones, modified Triumph Herald uprights and\ninboard coil-spring/damper units. The rear end was\nagain familiar Lotus: reversed lower wishbones, single top\nlinks, twin radius rods, uprights made of magnesium and\ninclined coil-spring/damper units. This set-up made\nadjusting the suspension rather difficult and somewhat\nlimited. The usual Metalastik doughnuts transferred\ntorque to the driveshafts.\nThe Cosworth-Ford 1098cc engine gained a fully\ncounterbalanced forged steel crankshaft which was much\ntougher in use. Hewland’s VW-derived Mk IV gearbox\nwas fitted, along with Girling outboard discs and 13-inch\ncast magnesium ‘wobbly web’ wheels. The disadvantage\nof the outboard brakes in terms of unsprung weight was\ncountered by the benefits in brake cooling.\nThe works Junior team for that year was re-named\nRon Harris-Team Lotus, since Harris ran it, but at first\nsuccess eluded the team’s drivers, Peter Arundell, Mike\nSpence and John Fenning.

After a few close run-ins, Arundell won\nthe British Grand Prix support race. His engine was down\non power but the handling set-up was, at last, exactly\nright and he had a race-long battle with Denny Hulme’s\nBrabham, which went to the final lap where Hulme\ncrashed out at Club Corner. Arundell followed this up by\nscoring five more consecutive victories – enough to snatch\nthe British Express & Star Formula Junior Championship\nfrom Hulme by just a single point.\nAs a result of the late development work on the Type\n27, customer cars were delayed, the first example going\nto Ecurie Ford-France in time for the Grand Prix des\nFrontieres at Chimay.

At the\nbeginning of the season, all the teams had full knowledge\nof the plans to institute a new Formula 2 series in 1964\nand the Type 27 was therefore designed to be capable of\ncompeting in the coming seasons F2 class.

        "content": "In the early 1960’s the Ford Motor Company made\na fateful decision to go motor racing and it would\nsubsequently come to dominate a generation of\nmotorsport with cars such as the GT40, Escort BDA and\nSierra Cosworth. The forerunner of all this success was\nthe first of the true homologation specials, the Lotus\nCortina (or as Ford dubbed it, the Cortina-Lotus).\nThe Cortina GT had already proven itself in rallies\nand circuit racing, but it was becoming uncompetitive\nand Ford needed an evolution model. It was to Colin\nChapman that Walter Hayes of Ford turned to produce\na world-beating saloon racer. Since Lotus was always in\nneed of money, the project came as a welcome move.\nThe initial plan called for Lotus to assemble 1000 cars\nso that it could be homologated for Group 2 racing.\nThe Lotus Twin-cam head on the unburstable Ford\n1500 bottom end had already proved itself by dominating\nthe opening ten laps of the Nurburgring 1000km on its\nspectacular debut. The same close-ratio four-speed\ngearbox as in the Elan was specified, but under the skin,\nthe Cortinas suspension was changed considerably. The\nfront got new spring and damper rates which reduced\nthe ride height, while the rear end was now located by\nan A-frame and twin radius arms with springing by\ncoil-spring/damper units.\nColin made other changes too. The bodyshell\nincorporated light alloy skins for the doors, bonnet and\nboot lid, while lightweight aluminium was used for the\nclutch housing and differential housing. The full-width\nfront bumper was ditched in favour of quarter bumpers\nand Lotus badges appeared on the rear wings and grille.\nBraking was enhanced by the use of disc brakes on the\nfront wheels and enlarged drums at the rear, both helped\nby vacuum servo assistance. Inside there was a new centre\nconsole covering the remote gear-change, bucket seats,\npistol-grip handbrake and a wood-rim steering wheel.\nProduction of the Type 28 started in February 1963,\nthe basic price being £910, and despite the fact that the\nrequired number of cars had not yet been built, the car\nwas homologated in September 1963. Typically, racing\nCortinas had around 150bhp (compared to 105bhp in\nroad cars). There were some early teething problems, but\nthe Lotus Cortina went on to dominate saloon car racing\nand rallying. It seemed to attract all the right drivers:\nGraham Hill, Jackie Stewart, Vic Elford, Jack Sears,\nTrevor Taylor, Peter Arundell, Mike Spence, Jacky lckx,\nSir John Whitmore, Frank Gardner and Roger Clark.\nHowever, it is the style of the inimitable Jim Clark\nwhich will forever be associated with this car. The balance\nof the car was far better than anything else on the circuits\nat that time, and Clark’s ability to four-wheel-drift the car\nat almost any speed proved to be the dominant factor in\nthe 1964 BRSCC Saloon Car Championship.\nWhile Team Lotus campaigned in Britain, Ford raced\ncars in the USA and Alan Mann Racing took the banner\nto Europe on behalf of Ford. In 1965 Sir John Whitmore\ntook his red and gold Alan Mann car to outright victory\nin the European Saloon Car Championship and in 1966,\nand just to set the seal on the Lotus Cortina’s versatility,\nBengt Soderstrom and Gunnar Palm won the RAC Rally.\nProduction changes included the deletion of\naluminium panels and castings, discontinued as standard\nfittings in July 1964 (they continued to be available as\nextras). In October 1964, a face-lifted SE model arrived\nwith Aeroflow ventilation, a full-width grille, two-piece\npropshaft, different gear ratios and other minor\nalterations. Early in its production life Lotus enhanced the\nSE model with improved engine performance, Dunlop SP\ntyres, adjustable rear suspension and if you were really\nlucky a ‘Special Equipment’ badge on the rear panel.\nThe 1965 Group 2 car was homologated with\nleafspring rear suspension in place of the A-frame, while\nthe engines were tuned by BRM. Back to back testing had\nshown the leaf spring car to be just as fast as the ‘\nA\n’ spring\nversion, which was prone to cracking its differential case.\nTeam Lotus cars were driven by Jim Clark and Jack\nLotus Cortina\nType 28\nMODEL\nType 28\nNAME/FORMULA\nLotus Cortina\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1963-66\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2894\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus-Ford Twin-cam\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1558cc/105-110bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n168in/62.5in/54in\nWHEELBASE\n98.5in\nWEIGHT\n1822lb/826kg\nSears (the latter finished fourth overall and first in class, and shared victory in the\nNürburgring Six-hours with Whitmore). 1966 saw Team Lotus campaign fuel-injected\ncars in Group 5 (seen above at Goodwood with Clark at the wheel), and win the\nEntrants’ award in the British Saloon Car Championship.\nProduction ceased in September 1966 as the Cheshunt factory closed, although it\nis believed that a few more cars may have been assembled at Ford’s Dagenham plant.\nOver three years some 2894 cars had been built, virtually all in Ermine White with\na Sherwood Green flash applied by Lotus. Around 40 red bodyshells are believed to\nhave been built and used, mostly for race and rally cars, including the Alan Mann cars.\nIn 1967 a MkII Cortina version was produced but this, unlike the MkI, was\nassembled by Ford using parts supplied by Lotus, and was thus not allocated a Lotus\nType number. The Lotus badges remained but Ford would officially demote it to a mere\nTwin-Cam Cortina. As for the Mk I, not only was it a resounding success on the race\ntracks of the world, providing Ford with the high profile sporting image which it sought\nso badly, but along with the Elan helped give Lotus Cars much needed financial stability.\n"

Gurney\nhad been impressed when he had seen the Type\n25 in Formula 1 and thought a light-weight, mid-\nengined car could do well against the heavy and\npredominantly front engined Indy Roadsters.\na lightweight, low-powered car which could run on\nregular pump fuel (most ran on methanol) was viewed\nwith scepticism, but tests showed that the slower speed on\nnormal fuel was outweighed by better economy, meaning\nfewer time-consuming pit stops. Ford went for Lotus, and\nthe Type 29 was born.\nIn general principle the construction of the Type 29\nmonocoque followed that of the Formula 1 Type 25. It\nwas wider, taller and had a five-inch longer wheelbase,\npartly because of the regulations (which set a minimum\nwheelbase length of 96-inches) and partly because of the\nroom needed to accommodate the Ford V8 engine. Lotus\nalso cited the considerably taller stance of Gurney,\ncompared to Clark, as another reason for the increased\ndimensions. The side members were 1¼-inches deeper\nand slightly wider than the 25’s, and were increased in size\nto accommodate 42 gallons of fuel to minimise pit stops.\nThe engine came from Ford of America, which\nsupplied an all-aluminium, dry-sump 4.2-litre V8 engine.\nIn place of the usual fuel injection, Lotus preferred four\nDCOE 58 Weber carbs, and claimed the V8 Ford\ndeveloped around 400bhp at 7000rpm. With a power-to\nweight ratio of approximately 800bhp per ton, Lotus felt\njustified in claiming that this was “one of the most, if not\nthe most, potent pieces of racing machinery ever built,\nsurpassing even that of the pre-war Mercedes and Auto-\nUnions,” and went on to say that the Type 29 could be\nexpected “to break almost every circuit lap record.”\nA rear-mounted, four-speed Type 37A Colotti\ngearbox was used with two ratios blanked off. In order\nto counteract centrifugal forces on the banked Hoosier\ncircuit, the engine and transmission were offset by\n25⁄8-inches. The gear lever and its two-piece linkage were\nlocated on the right-hand side of the cockpit, the link\nbeing about waist high and almost straight for its entire\nlength. Girling brakes were fitted, the Type 29 being the\nThe Indy 500 was the largest sporting event in the USA at the time, with 300,000\nspectators, and it was probably the world’s richest motor race. When Colin Chapman\nsaw the 1962 race he exclaimed, “\nAll you’ve got to do is to get an engine with half the\npower of these great lumps of junk, build a decent chassis and you’ve won the race.”\nCoincidentally, Ford of Dearborn also had plans for the Indy 500. Colin heard about\nthis, and in July 1962 went with Gurney to meet with Ford in Detroit. His proposal for\nfirst car with discs of 10½-inch diameter both front and\nrear, and provision was made for fitting even larger discs\nand calipers.\nAfter a first test outing at Snetterton (where the lap\nrecord was easily broken), in March 1963 the first Type 29\nleft for testing at Ford’s private track in Arizona. It was\nmerely a test machine, or ‘mule’ not intended to start the\nrace. Two further cars were built, one for Jim Clark and\none for Dan Gurney.\nIn qualifying for the 1963 Indy 500, Jim Clark took\nfifth place on the grid, right up with the Offenhauser\npowered cars which had dominated the event for 30 years.\nGurney, though, crashed his car in practice and was\nforced to drive a cobble-up of his crashed car and the mule.\nIn the race itself Clark and Gurney slipped back to\ntenth early on, before a round of pit stops saw Clark surge\ninto the lead, and Gurney into second. Gurney was forced\nto make three pit stops compared to Clark’s single stop\nwhich, as planned, put him right in the running. The car’s\nlight weight (at 1130lb, some 450lb lighter than most of\nthe field), advanced suspension, and an engine which ran\non pump fuel enabled it to run for 28 laps in the lead\n(gaining Clark a $4200 prize). Clark might have won the\nrace had yellow ‘no passing’ lights not held things up for\nfully one hour, and had the stewards listened to\nChapman’s impeachment to black flag the leading car of\nParnelli Jones which was leaking oil badly. In the event\nClark came second to Jones, Gurney coming home\nseventh. Still, Clark’s winnings of $55,238 were probably\nmore than he had earned in his entire racing career!\nTo prove a point, Team Lotus entered the 29s in\nthe following Milwaukee event, where Clark won the\n200-mile race easily leading from start to finish and\nestablishing a new lap record."

In the 49 race starts the trio made, they placed\nno less than 38 times and took lap records at eight circuits.\nThe yellow and green liveried Ian Walker Racing\nTeam also fielded a 23B with much distinction in both the\nUK and the USA. With both Graham Hill (above) and\nPaul Hawkins behind the wheel of their immaculately\nprepared cars, they took class wins at several high profile\nmeetings in the USA.\nDuring early 1962 Lotus and Harry Mundy had been\nbusy developing the new Lotus Twin-cam engine for use\nin the Type 26 Elan, and it would have taken little\nimagination to predict its appearance in the small capacity\nType 23 sports car, which was already proving hugely\nsuccessful.

After lasting eleven of the daunting 14-mile laps,\nClark was overcome by fumes from a broken exhaust pipe,\nslid off the track, and was forced to retire. The impact of\nthe performance of both Clark and the modestly-powered\nsports racer, was however, felt throughout the European\nracing fraternity.\nBy early 1963, Lotus had launched the production\nversion of the car that had appeared in Germany,\ndesignated the Type 23B. Underneath the seemingly\nidentical bodywork, the chassis was substantially modified\nand strengthened to take the increased power (anything\nbetween 125 and 145bhp was being claimed by various\nengine builders) of the enlarged 1594cc version of the\nLotus Ford Twin-cam engine that by then was being fitted\nto the Elan roadcar.\nSports Racer\nType 23B\nMODEL\nType 23B\nNAME/FORMULA\nSports Racing Car\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1963\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nincluded in type 23\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus Ford Twin-cam\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1558cc/135bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n140in/59.5in/27in\nWHEELBASE\n90in\nWEIGHT\n950lb/431kg\nAdditionally, a Type 23B won the 1962 Montlhery 1000km race in the hands of Jose\nRosinski and Bernard Consten.

Fitted in place of the original four stud, bolt-on type, the\nnew wheels were held on by a three-eared knock on spinner which, were claimed in the\nElan S2 brochure to have ‘Lotus patent attachments’.\nA host of small and almost un-noticed changes included the revised rear light lenses\n(taken from Vauxhall), moving the battery (on some later S2 cars) to inside the left hand\nside of the boot, re-designed interior door handles, a re-calibrated oil pressure gauge\n(seemingly offering a better oil pressure by simply moving the numerals across the dial)\nand improvements to both the cooling and fuel supply systems.\nThe bodyshells for the Elan, which on all Series 1 cars\nhad been manufactured by a company called Bourne\nPlastics, were now being made by Lotus in a building just\ndown from the main factory in Delamare Road. When\nhe realised that the Bourne facility were having trouble\nmeeting quality standards and production levels whilst still\nmaintaining a realistic price for each body built, Colin\nhad bought this property specially for this purpose.\nThe new type of Lotus owner brought into the fold by\nthe Elan was certainly more critical of the product than\nthose of the halcyon days of the Eleven, Elite and Seven,\nand had demanded these types of improvements in\nproduction standards. The Series 2 Elan was certainly\na more civilised and better version of the original model,\nand strong sales through 1964 and into 1965 lifted the\nprofits of the company, just when it was needed most.\nThe years 1963-1965 were to be one of the most\nprofitable times at Lotus which was fortunate because\nthere were plans afoot to move the factory.

This was the second time this had happened\nto Lotus in the London area and Colin made the decision\nto move to a site he had seen near Norwich in East Anglia\nwhile on a shooting trip with Tony Rudd.\nConsidering that at the time, the Lotus works were\nmanufacturing around 125 cars a week, it was no mean\nfeat to pack up the complete production line and move\neverything to Norfolk.

However, others did, notably Lotus\nracer and IWR team boss Ian Walker, as well as Graham\nWarner of The Chequered Flag.\nIn standard road-going form the Elan was not the\ngreatest tool on the track and criticisms included bump\nsteer, vague and unpredictable handling as well as a\npropensity for broken wheels.\nWalker solved the bump steer problem by changing\nthe height of the steering rack and the handling was\ntightened up by replacing the rubber bushes with\nspherical bearings. As for the steel wheels, these were\nswapped for wider, centre-lock, magnesium wheels.\nAnother change was stiffer, shorter springs for a lower\nride height, which in turn meant raising the height of the\ndifferential to compensate for the acute half-shaft angles.\nWalker’s cars also gained small scoops on the lower\nbody ahead of the rear wheels to help cool the brakes and\ndifferential, while vertical slits behind the arches allowed\nhot air to escape. The pop-up headlamps were replaced\nwith simpler fixed lamps behind Plexiglas covers and the\nfront bumper was removed and blended in to the body to\nimprove aerodynamics. IWR had fairly standard engines\n(merely blueprinted, balanced and flowed) which\ndeveloped around 125bhp.\nTeam drivers were Peter Arundell, John Whitmore\n(right), Mike Spence and Paul Hawkins, while Jim Clark\ncame first in class in a ‘Gold Bug’ at the support race\nfor the 1964 Silverstone International Trophy.\nMeanwhile Graham Warner’s black and white\nChequered Flag car used a potent Cosworth developed\ntwin-cam engine with 144bhp on tap, with a bonnet\nMODEL\nType 26R\nNAME/FORMULA\nElan Sports Racer\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1964-66\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n97\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus Ford Twin-Cam\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1558cc/140-160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n145in/56in/46in\nWHEELBASE\n84in\nWEIGHT\n1385lb/628kg\nNACA duct for cooling. Because the radiator was sited\nfurther forward, the pop-up headlamps had to be\nreplaced with smaller lights behind transparent fairings.\nThe arches were cut away for wider tyres and the\nsuspension gained thicker anti-roll bars and adjustable\ntoe-in rear wishbones. This car was raced by Warner\nhimself, Mike Spence and Jackie Stewart.\nIncorporating many elements of both the Walker\nand Warner developed racing Elans, the designation 26R\nwas given to the official competition version of the Elan\nproduced by Lotus Components early in 1964. This was\noffered for sale to the public at £1995, in component\nform. Production 26Rs did not have rear wheel vents but\nhad widened front and rear bodywork that retained the\nstandard bumpers that accommodated wide cast\nmagnesium wheels. Lightweight single-skin glassfibre\nhardtop bodywork was used through-out, and some\nexamples had a NACA duct on the bonnet. Export cars\nretained the Elan’s pop-up lamps but domestic cars\nfollowed the Walker/Warner cowled lamp practice.\nAll had a triangulated roll-over bar behind the seat.\nOn the suspension, special competition wishbones\nwere installed, sliding-spline driveshafts replaced the\nrubber joints, thicker front and a rear anti-roll bars were\ninstalled and the frame was made stronger at the\nsuspension pick-up points. There were dual-circuit brakes\nwith twin master cylinders, light-alloy calipers with racing\npads and a revised pedal layout to ease heel-and-toeing.\nThe standard engine was a Cosworth tuned version of\nthe Twin-cam, which produced at least 140bhp and\neventually delivered as much as 160bhp. The gearbox and\nlimited-slip differential were now cased in magnesium.\nThe 26R proved a strong racing competitor,\nparticularly in club events. A Team Lotus works car was\ncampaingned and driven in several races by Team Lotus\nmechanic Ray Parsons, but many private teams raced\n26Rs, including SMART (Stirling Moss Automobile\nElan Racecar\nType 26R\nRacing Team) and Team Willment. The latter fitted a 158bhp BRM Phase 2 Lotus\nengine and, with John Miles at the helm, won the 1966 Autosport Championship.\nDuring 1965 and 1966 Ian Walker used one of his 26Rs [LRO 8C] in several road\nrallies both in the UK and Europe, scoring some good results including 1st overall\nin the 1966 Jacobean Rally.\nIn early 1965 the Series 2 Elan roadcar was coming on line and thus prompted the\ndevelopment of a 26R ‘Series 2’. First shown at the 1965 Racing Car Show the S2 car\nfeatured a number of revisions designed to increase power and improve handling. As\never, factory records for 26R production are somewhat vague and feature missing, and\nor duplicated chassis numbers throughout the production of Series 1 and Series 2 cars,\nfrom 1964 to 1966. The commonly accepted number of 26Rs officially built is 97, but\nit is probable that more that 100 cars came off the line at Lotus Components in varying\nspecification that often makes it hard to identify a true 26R amongst the many 26R\nreplicas that were built in the day.\n"

In any event, he had his way and went on to\ndevelop the Type 30.\nThe backbone chassis of the Type 30 was inspired by\nthe road going Elan: a central box section with a rear\nY-fork (which accommodated the mid-mounted engine\nand suspension assemblies) and a deep transverse box\nsection at the front to carry the suspension. The central\nbackbone was panelled in 20-gauge mild steel (found to\nbe not stiff enough and uprated to 16-gauge after the\nfirst three chassis had been built); housed inside it was a\n3-gallon rubber fuel tank (additional 9-gallon tanks could\nbe installed in each of the body sills).\nFront suspension was by semi-trailing unequal length\ndouble wishbones and coil-spring/damper units, while at\nthe rear the usual reversed lower wishbones and radius\nrods were supplemented by another novelty – upper\nwishbones.

As\npurchased from Ford in Hi-Performance tune it developed\n271bhp, but after Lotus had modified it and added four\nWeber carburettors, it produced around 350bhp. A ZF\nfive-speed gearbox was fitted and, with the highest final\ndrive ratio, a 200mph top speed was theoretically possible.\nAlthough the prototype displayed at the London\nRacing Car Show had an aluminium body, production\ncars got glassfibre bodywork.

A better result awaited in October\nwhen Clark came home third in California. The\noverheating problem was recurrent, and was eventually\ncured by re-piping the cooling system. Poor braking also\ndogged the 30, and Series 1 cars never had particularly\nrigid structures. There was also concern that the Ford V8\nwas underpowered, although the lightness of the Lotus\nframe compensated. The 30 was offered to the public at\na reasonable £3495 and the first private sale was to David\nProphet, who raced extensively in South Africa. Some\ntwenty-one examples of the Series 1 car were built.\nFor 1965 a Series 2 version arrived. This had a\nsimplified rear suspension mounting set-up, meaning that\ntransmission work no longer required the removal of the\nsuspension; other changes included a new upswept tail\nspoiler, 10¼-inch ventilated discs in 15-inch wheels with\nlow-profile Dunlop R7 tyres and a nose-mounted oil\ncooler. Tecalemit-Jackson fuel injection was also adopted\nin place of Webers, which gave a reliable 360bhp, but\nan experiment with 5.3-litre Ford power at Oulton Park\nground to a halt when it exploded during practice.\nTwelve Series 2 cars were built and that season Clark\nwon the Senior Service 200 road race at Silverstone and\nagain at Goodwood on Easter Monday.

By now tubular steel\nconstruction had been abandoned by Lotus in the its single-seaters, but it\nwas felt that the monocoque construction was not suitable, in terms of\ncost and repairability, for Formula 3. Its solution was to revise, in mild\nterms, the 1962 Lotus Type 22 Formula Junior car, and introduce it as the\nType 31 Formula 3 car.\nThe chassis was basically the same as that of the 22: round and square\nsection tubing with a bulkhead which held the instruments and the\nsteering column bracket, at the forward end of the cockpit.\nSuspension at the front was by unequal length double wishbones, an\nanti-roll bar and outboard Armstrong coil-spring/damper units.

Magnesium hub carriers were fitted at the rear but\nproprietary units were used on the front wheels. Girling discs were fitted\nall round, outboard at all four corners. The wheels of early examples\nwere Elan-type pressed steel at the front and Lotus Cortina at the rear.\nLotus Components, rather than Team Lotus, were now building and\noffering the Type 31 for sale and regulations stipulated that four-cylinder\nproduction-based engines up to 1000cc with standard valve gear and a\nsingle-choke carburettor had to be fitted. Lotus offered two choices of\nengine: the Holbay R65 modified Ford unit, fitted with a twin-choke\nWeber carburettor (blanked off on one side), and the Cosworth MAE unit.\nThe cost was £1975 assembled for a Cosworth car, and £2000 with a\nHolbay engine. Originally the car was available with either modified\nRenault or Volkswagen four-speed transmission but the Hewland-\nmodified VW gearbox eventually became standard.\nAgainst the monocoque competition of the dominant Cooper-BMCs,\nthe Lotus had little success in 1964; in fact few of the top drivers chose the\nLotus Type 31 in Formula 3 and records show that a total of only 12\nexamples were built during 1964 and 1965. In 1966, 19 cars were built with\ntheir chassis numbered ‘22/F3.....’ but officially recorded as Type 31s to\nmake them eligible for racing.\nThe first ‘official’ Formula Ford race was held at Brands Hatch in\nJuly 1967 where five ‘Jim Russell Racing Drivers School’ Lotus 31s were\nentered. Although Ray Allen’s Lotus 51 won the event, a trio of Type\n31s followed in the next three places, so the Type 31 has at least\nsome historical importance.\nFormula 3\nType 31\n"

Ron Harris Team Lotus achieved some good\nresults in 1964 with its four cars, even though its main\ndrivers Jim Clark and Mike Spence were often engaged in\nother events and unable to race, leaving stand-in drivers,\nwho were unfamiliar with the cars, to deputise.\nClark won the Pau Grand Prix, the Eifelrennen in\nGermany and the Guards Trophy at Brands Hatch, and\ncame second in the Kanonloppet races in Sweden as well\nas the Oulton Park Gold Cup. Spence won the Aintree\n‘200’ and Peter Procter came second in the Vienna GP\nand on the Circuit of Berlin. The fourth ‘regular,’ Peter\nArundell, crashed badly and Reims and suffered serious\ninjuries. As for the stand-ins, Jackie Stewart won at\nSnetterton and finished second in the Ile de France race\nat Montlhery, while Brian Hart won the Enna race in\nSicily. Overall, Lotus won seven of the 18 major Formula\n2 races that year. Not too bad but, considering their driver\nline-up compared to that of the Brabham team, who won\nmost of the other races, 1964 was little disappointing.\nA total of twelve examples of what many consider\nto be one of the prettiest formula racecars ever, the Type\n32, were built in 1964. There was, however, a follow-up\none-off, actually constructed around chassis 32-7, called\nthe 32B built in late 1964 (see page 57).\nJust as the 1100cc Type 27 was finally becoming\ncompetitive in Formula Junior, in 1964 the Italian\nderived formula was replaced by two new racing\nclasses, Formula 2 and Formula 3. The Lotus\nFormula 3 car would be the tube chassis Type\n31, while for Formula 2 Lotus opted to build a\ndevelopment of the monocoque chassis Type 27\nFormula Junior car, which became the Type 32.\nFormula 2\nType 32\nThe Type 32 was larger than the Type 27, expanding\nmore towards the size of the Formula 1 Type 25. The\nmonocoque construction remained, though now with\n16-gauge steel panelling and with the D-shaped longerons\nat each side of the chassis, containing flexible rubber fuel\ntanks of nine gallons capacity each. Suspension followed\nthe usual Lotus practice; the coil-spring/damper units\nwere mounted inboard at the front and outboard at the\nrear. The front wishbones were slightly wider-based than\non the Type 27, while the rear geometry also changed,\nthere was full adjustability (unlike the awkward-to-work\non Type 27). The Girling 10½-inch brake discs were\nmounted outboard all round.\nThe new F2 rules stated that a production-based\nblock had to be used, with a capacity of no more than\n1000cc. Colin Chapman considered using the Elan’s\ntwin-cam head but it proved unsuitable for Formula 2\napplication, while Coventry Climax did not pursue the\nidea of expanding half of its 1.5-litre V8 engine to create\na Formula 2 unit. Instead Colin opted for the new 998cc\nCosworth SCA engine, distantly based on the Ford Anglia\n105E block. With a single gear-driven overhead camshaft\nand twin 40DCM2 Weber carburettors, it was good for an\nimpressive 115bhp at 8700rpm. The engine was canted\nover at an angle of 25 degrees in the chassis and was\nmated to a Hewland six-speed gearbox."

An extraordinarily good result for a single driver/\ncar entry in this highly competitive series.\nThe Type 32B is unique in Lotus history in that it was\ndesigned and built specifically for Jim Clark, and only he\ndrove it for all thirteen of its races with Team Lotus. And\nwhat’s more, it won nearly seventy-five percent of the\nraces it competed in.\nAs happened with many of the Team Lotus Tasman\ncars over the years, and ostensibly to save the cost of\nshipping the car back to the UK, at the end of the 1965\nseries, the 32B was sold off to a local racer. In the case\nof the 32B, this was New Zealand racer Jim Palmer, who\nfinished best of the locals in the Tasman Championship\nAfter missing the Tasman races held in Australia and\nNew Zealand during the Antipodean summer months\nof January to March for a period of three years, Colin\nChapman made the decision to return to this popular\nseries, and the one-off Type 32B was built for the eight\nTasman Formula events to be held in Australia and New\nZealand in early 1965. The 32B was fitted with a 2495cc\nCoventry Climax FPF engine, which required its forward\nmonocoque section to be combined with a modified\ntubular rear sub-frame and a large humped engine cover\nthat completely covered the roll-hoop behind the driver.\nSuspension was essentially the same as on the Type 32.\nJim Clark was the sole works Lotus entry in the series and,\nthe following year. A succession of third and fourth place finishes left Palmer fourth in\nthe championship that year, just four points shy of Jim Clark in the one-off, 1966 Lotus\nTasman contender, the Type 39.\nModified and driven over the following years by subsequent owners Tony Roxburgh\nand Mel McEwin, the 32B was then stored in a Melbourne warehouse for nearly\neighteen years, before, in the mid-1980s, the car was discovered and returned to its\noriginal 1964 specification by New South Wales Lotus collector John Dawson-Damer.\nWhen discovered, the monocoque, engine and rear suspension set-up were all\nremarkably original and in reasonably good condition, given the fact that the car\nhad been used hard for several seasons of private ownership.\nThis unique car is now owned by Classic Team Lotus in the UK and has been\ncampaigned in many European historic events including Goodwood and Monaco.\n"

        "content": "1964\nThe Type 33 was the ultimate evolution of the\nrevolutionary Type 25 Formula 1 car that had\nbeen designed and built in 1962. Its chassis\nnumbering sequence even carried on directly\nfrom the Type 25’s. Although the two cars\nlooked virtually identical, no parts were in fact\ninterchangeable between the two models.\nIn 1965 Clark completely dominated F1, easily\nwinning the championship, mostly at the wheel of the\nType 33 (he also use a 25 in some events such as the\nFrench GP). He scored six victories that year, five of them\nwith the Type 33. At the Belgian GP in June, the Team\nLotus cars were converted from the earlier ‘bolt-on’ type\nto cast-alloy 6-spoke wheels to ones with knock-off\nwheel centre fixings.\nMike Spence also featured fairly well in the 1965\nresults tables, scoring one third placing and two fourths.\nThe Lotus 33 also won three non-championship events\nthat year, including a win for Mike Spence at the Race\nof Champions at Brands Hatch, which compensated\nsomewhat for Clark’s alarming total destruction of\nchassis number R10 in the same event.\n1966 marked a change in F1 regulations, allowing\nengines of up to 3.0-litres, and, although Lotus intended\nto fade out the Type 33 during the season, it proved a\nuseful back-up for the troublesome and heavyweight\nBRM-H16 powered Type 43. A single Type 33 was built\nto the 3-litre formula and was ready for the British GP at\nBrands Hatch. It had a 2-litre V8 engine built specially for\nLotus by Leonard Lee’s Coventry-Climax team, and was\ndriven by Clark, Peter Arundell and Pedro Rodriguez.\nAlthough outclassed that year by the cars from Brabham\nand Ferrari, Clark achieved two third places and one\nfourth, while Spence and Arundell took an excellent first\nand third places in the non-championship South African\nGrand Prix.\nClark raced the Type 33 again in 1967, in a car\nofficially dubbed the 33T: the ‘T’ stood for Tasman, after\nthe Tasman Championship which he dominated, gaining\nfive wins and three second places. Graham Hill rejoined\nthe Lotus fold to race a 2.1-litre BRM-powered Type 33T\nat the International Trophy at Silverstone (coming fourth)\nand at the Monaco GP\n, where he finished a fine second.\nUnlike the Type 25, whose cockpit sides kinked in forward\nof the dash panel to converge around the pedals, the 33’s\nwere straight from the seat back to the pedal box, making\nthe monocoque stronger and simpler to build. The\nwheelbase was very slightly longer (by three-quarters of\nan inch) to accommodate the latest Coventry Climax flat-\ncrank V8 engine. As for the suspension, that essentially\nfollowed the improvements seen on the Type 25B.\nThe very first Type 33, chassis number R8, initially\nhad very lightweight suspension components made of\nthin-wall chromed steel. These proved to be very brittle,\nas Jim Clark discovered when the suspension failed during\ntesting and, as he spun the car to a stop, the suspension\nshattered completely. More conventional tubing was\nsubstituted. The major aspect of the 33’s suspension was\nthat it was designed around Dunlop’s new smaller 13-inch\nwheel and tyre combination.\nThe 33’s racing debut was at the 1964 Aintree ‘200’,\nbut Jim Clark was baulked by a back-marker and crashed\nbadly during the race. The car (chassis number R8) had to\nbe rebuilt over the next two months and Clark was forced\nto revert to his trusty Type 25 for most of the rest of the\n1964 season. However, he did win with R8 in the non-\nchampionship Solitude GP in July. This car was later sold\noff and raced during the 1965 season by Dickie Stoop,\nalso appearing in the MGM film ‘Grand Prix’. Both\nClark and Mike Spence raced Type 33s in the German\nGP at the Nurburgring but with little success.\nAt the end of the year non-championship Rand GP\n,\nJackie Stewart was invited by Colin Chapman to take over\nClark’s car, after he had injured himself in a snowball\nfight! Stewart made his Formula 1 debut and one of his\nrare appearances in a Lotus in the Type 33. Winning the\nsecond heat of the two race event, however, did little to\nhelp his cause and he was classified a lowly 17th overall,\nafter suffering drive shaft failure in the first heat.\nFormula 1\nType 33"

However, the trump card\nof the Type 29 – namely its use of normal pump fuel –\nwas carried over for racing the new Indy 500 contender,\nto be called the Type 34.\nThe 34’s transmission changed from the Colotti to\nLotus’ more usual choice of ZF\n, albeit with only two\nspeeds. Additionally the Saginaw driveshafts were\nreplaced by smaller shafts with rubber couplings, and\nLotus magnesium wheels replaced the Dunlop wheels\nused at Indy in 1963.\nWithout a doubt, the most controversial aspect of the\nType 34 was its tyres. Lotus selected special Dunlop racing\ntyres, even though Ford favoured harder but less tenacious\nFirestones, which Bobby Marshman was using on his\nolder Type 29. The Dunlops were certainly quick, but the\nfirst indication of problems came when Dan Gurney tried\nrunning with full tanks, and the tyres began shedding\nlarge lumps of tread, after problems with overheating.\nDunlop was forced to revise its moulds with a shallower\ntread pattern and new tyres were made for the race in\ndouble-quick time.\nJim Clark qualified on pole position, Marshman\nin his Type 29 was second, Rodger Ward was third in a\nmid-engined Watson-Offenhauser and Dan Gurney, in\nthe other Type 34 (below left), shared the second row\nwith Parnelli Jones and AJ Foyt.\nThe race was red-flagged after the first lap because of\na massive pile-up, but, after the restart, Clark led for five\nlaps. Marshman then passed him, only for Clark to retake\nthe lead on lap 33. Seven laps later there was vibration\nfrom the rear end, shortly followed by a terrific crash as\nthe left rear suspension collapsed. What was the problem?\n1964\nIt was with a sense of optimism that Lotus\napproached the 1964 Indianapolis 500 after\nits near-victory the previous year. Buoyed up\nby the promising association with Lotus, Ford\nof Dearborn produced a development of the\nV8 engine with a new quad-cam, four valves\nper cylinder head and Hilborn-derived fuel\ninjection rather than carburettors.\nInevitably it was the tyres which had shed so much tread\nthat an imbalance vibration had literally shaken the\nsuspension into collapse. As it was also suffering tyre\ndamage, Gurney’s car was brought into the pits as a safety\nmeasure. To rub salt in Ford’s wounds, Foyt (who might\nhave been driving the spare 34) won the race driving an\nold style Watson-Offy roadster.\nFord declared a moratorium on the disastrous race\nand an apologetic Chapman was forced to sell the cars to\nFord, on the understanding that he would be allowed to\ncampaign the two Type 34s at Milwaukee and Trenton.\nTest driver Walt Hansgen managed to crash a works 34\nat Milwaukee and again at Trenton, but at last there was\nto be victory for the Type 34. Ford got Parnelli Jones to\naccompany Clark at Trenton and, while Clark retired\nwith engine trouble, Jones won convincingly. Foyt joined\nJones to drive in the USAC race at Milwaukee (Clark\nand Gurney were in the Austrian GP that weekend), and\nJones led the race from start to finish; Foyt retired after\na gear-shift bracket failed.\nIn 1965 the surviving Type 34s were campaigned by\nJones and Foyt, and at the Indy 500 that year, Foyt in his\n‘Sheraton-Thompson Special’ took pole position and\nJones fourth, surrounded by other Lotus cars. All five top\ngrid positions were taken by Lotus that year, with Clark in\nthe new Type 38 second on the grid. When a suspension\nupright failed on Jones’ car, the USAC Safety Committee\ngrounded not only the non-works Type 34s but the new\nType 38s as well, making Colin Chapman understandably\nfurious. With new uprights fitted on all five Lotus entries,\na low-on-fuel Jones succeeded in eking out a superb\nsecond place to Clark’s winning Type 38, Foyt retired\nwith transmission failure.\nIndycar\nType 34\n60"

It\nwas about four-inches longer but very similar in external\nappearance. The monocoque hull was made of high\nstrength sheet steel together with steel load-bearing box\nmembers at each end and with aluminium integral side\npanels. At the front, wide-based lower wishbones were\nused in conjunction with F1 cast uprights similar to the\nLotus 24 and 25 cars. At the rear, a pair of non-parallel\ntwin radius rods were fitted on taller rear uprights. As with\nthe 32, the suspension was made fully adjustable after all\nthe problems experienced with the Formula Junior 27s\nand their limited adjustment suspension.\nColin Chapman decided that it would be a useful\nexercise to build a car that could take various power units\nthat would enable it to race in several formulae. In fact\nseven different engine variations were possible. The\nstandard unit was the Formula 2 Cosworth SCA 1000cc\nSOHC twin-carburettor engine that produced 117bhp,\nalthough Lotus Components also listed the fuel-injected\n1000cc BRM twin-cam unit for Formula 2. The Type 35\ncould also be used in the American Formula B Series\nwhen a 150bhp 1.6-litre Lotus-Ford Twin-cam would be\nfitted. Again, Lotus Components listed other options,\nnamely a Cosworth 1.5-litre twin-cam, as well as a\nFormula 3 specification 1-litre, Cosworth MAE engine.\nThere was also a listing on the official Team Lotus\nspecification sheet for a Tasman Formula version of the\ncar. With a little work it was possible to modify the car\nto take the Coventry Climax FPF four-cylinder 2.5-litre\nengine, although it seems that just one example of the\nTasman Type 35 was built sometime between early May\nand late July 1966, painted blue and reputedly sold to\nLotus Southwest in Texas for an un-named customer.\nChassis 35/F/18 differs substantially from other 35s in\nthat it was constructed around an ex-Ron Harris F2\nType 35 with an all-aluminium monocoque, fitted with\na ZF 5 DS 20 gearbox and using primarily Formula 1\nType 33 suspension and wheels.\nTeam Lotus’ Formula 2 participation for 1965 was\nagain looked after by Ron Harris. The early part of the\n1965 season saw the official team running a combination\nof both 32s and 35s but as the factory completed more\nnew cars, the obsolete 32s were retired and the new 35s,\nproving far superior, took their place. The unfortunate\nproblem was that the Type 35 was not as fast in a straight\nline as the rivals, despite the fact that the engines used\nproduced between 117bhp and 124bhp from only\n1.0-litre. However, the handling, which was up to the\nusual high Lotus standard, closed the gap somewhat.\nFormula 2\nType 35\nMike Spence drove chassis number 1, while chassis number 2 was driven by Peter\nRevson and number 3 by Jim Clark. Other notable drivers of the Formula 2 Type 35s\nwere Brian Hart, David Hobbs, Graham Hill, Bob Bondurant, Bernard Collomb and\nRay Parsons (the last named driving for the Willment Team).\nOf course there was also the matter of talent in Lotus’ favour. Jim Clark was clearly\nthe most successful 35 pilot, winning five events and also taking two thirds and a sixth\nplace. This was enough to win both The Autocar Championship and the Grands Prix\nde France series. The five Lotus victories matched the number of Brabham wins that\nseason. The Ron Harris and Willment teams also entered Type 35s in Formula 3, events\nbut with scant success against the dominant Brabhams. Only Revson in a Ron Harris\nType 35 scored a win, but at least this was at the season’s blue-riband event, the\nprestigious Monaco F3 race.\nAs the 1965 season progressed, factory development of the car was halted as attention\nfocused on the new Type 41 Formula 3 car for next year. In total some 22 examples of\nthe Type 35 were built and raced in Formula 2 & 3.\n"

        "content": "The problem for Lotus was that its Type 33 would need a substantial redesign because it\nused the full length of its hull for fuel storage, and there would be no space for this option\nwith the flat-16 engine. Lotus therefore built a new chassis (number R12 in the 25/33\nsequence) with notably wider sides and no rear chassis legs.\nThen the unexpected happened. Coventry Climax encountered endless delays\nand teething problems with its flat-16 and eventually announced that any further\ndevelopment would be reluctantly abandoned (its existing V8 was, in any case, proving\nto be the dominant power plant in F1). So Lotus had built a sleek one-off monocoque,\nfor an engine that would sadly never run.\nMODEL\nType 39\nNAME/FORMULA\nTasman\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1965-67\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nCoventry Climax FPF\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2495cc/220-230bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n140in/68in/31in\nWHEELBASE\n91.5in\nWEIGHT\n1250lb/567kg\n1965\nIn 1965 Lotus constructed the Type 39 as its\nnew Formula 1 contender. The whole project\ncentred around a brand new flat-16 engine\nbeing developed by Coventry Climax, the\nFWMW. This fantastically complex but compact\nunit was designed to offer a lower centre of\ngravity without requiring a major chassis\nredesign. Three teams were to receive the\nnew engine: Lotus, Brabham and Cooper.\nTasman Car\nType 39\nLotus was obliged to stick with the faithful Climax V8\nfor F1, and the wide-bodied 39 effort was seemingly at a\ndead end, or would have been, had Lotus not elected, in\nlate 1965 to turn it into its Tasman Championship car for\n1966. Once again it was decided to use the venerable old\n2.5-litre Climax FPF four-cylinder engine but, since it was\nnot a common sight by that stage, Lotus had to buy a pair\nin from Bruce McLaren. The engine was installed at 20\ndegrees to the vertical and mated to a Hewland HD5\ngearbox. The inclined engine installation made it easier\nfor a dog-leg tube and a sheet-metal diagonal to tie up the\ntop of the engine bay. A sheet-steel tray extended from the\nfirewall under the engine to the rear bulkhead. Pierced\nand swaged for lightness and partly double skinned, it\nseems likely that it formed part of the structure originally\nintended for the flat-16 engine.\nLotus had just signed a deal with Firestone, so the\nAmerican tyres would be used instead of the regular\nDunlops. Firestone used the Tasman series as a\ndevelopment ground for its latest racing rubber and it\nwould be fair to say that Lotus was disadvantaged at the\nfirst few races of the series. The new car was dubbed the\n39B for the Tasman series and Jim Clark again raced\nunder the Team Lotus banner.\nIn the opening event at Pukekohe in New Zealand\nhe retired after just six laps, but he came home second\nat Levin. He took pole at Teretonga ahead of Jackie\nStewart’s BRM but spun out on an oil patch in the race\nproper. As the circus moved North to Australia, Clark was\nin a rather disappointing seventh place overall but there\nwas some consolation ahead. At Warwick Farm, a course\nwhich favoured the old four-cylinder Climax engine,\nClark won his first and only victory of the series, which\nelevated him to second in the championship behind\nStewart. This performance could not be sustained\nhowever, and despite a second place at Sandown Park,\nhe could only finish the series in a disappointing third\nplace, behind the two BRMs of Stewart and Hill.\nAustralian Lotus agent Leo Geoghegan had taken a\nliking to the Type 39, and immediately after the final race\nof the series he acquired it from Chapman. He was the\nonly owner-driver in the front rank of Australian racing\nat the time and went on to make a big impression with\nthe car, which was repainted white with his sponsor\nTotal Oil’s blue and red stripes.\nGeoghegan raced the 39 regularly over the coming\nyears. He originally had a long-stroke Climax engine\nfitted but the block was cracked and a locally-made\nRepco block was substituted.With this he challenged for\nthe 1967 Tasman series before changing engines to a\n2.5-litre Repco 620 V8 for both 1968 and 1969. In the\nfinal round of the 1969 Tasman series at Sandown,\nGeoghegan was a mere 1.6 seconds off Jochen Rindt’s\npole time in qualifying, but a fuel leak scuppered what\nmight have been his most promising race. Although he\nwas often the leading owner-driver in the Tasman and\nGold Star championships, overall the Type 39 was an\nunpredictable performer.\nIronically, one of the 39’s best performances was when\nit deputised for Geoghegan’s new Lotus 59, which was not\nready for the opening 1970 Gold Star event at Symmons\nPlains, and he brought the 39 home in second place.\nIt also had the dubious distinction, when Geoghegan\nqualified closely behind Graham Hill at Sandown Park\nin ’69, of Hill coming over and exclaiming: ‘It’s a bloody\nquick old bastard!’"

Colin\nChapman even enjoyed one of his last competitive outings\nas a driver in the 7½ when he competed in the 1962\nSilverstone Six-Hour Relay race.\nFollowing this semi-official Seven was another\ndevelopment in the same vein, but it was given a proper\nLotus Type number, 37. Although since it was based\naround the Seven, it was always known as the Lotus\nThree-7. This project was conceived as a new-generation\nClubmans racer for the 1965 season. The Clubmans\nFormula had been introduced by the British Racing and\nSports Car Club (BRSCC) and British Automobile\nRacing Club (BARC) in 1964, to provide a championship\nfor cars such as the Seven which were being outclassed by\nspecialised mid-engined machinery in sports car racing.\nThe Formula was based around open-wheeled two-seaters\nwith a front-mounted Ford engine. Lotus 7s were\na popular choice and highly competitive, but not as\nsuccessful as the Arthur Mallock-designed Mallock U2.\nPerhaps this provided the necessary incentive to create\na serious Lotus challenge in this formula, as Lotus was so\ndominant in just about every other formula in which it\ncompeted. Colin made some noises that he wanted to\nhave a competitive car in the Clubmans formula, so\nPeter Warr, head of Lotus Components at the time,\nworked on the development of the 37.\nMODEL\nType Three-7\nNAME/FORMULA\nClubmans Formula\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1965\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cosworth 116E\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1498cc/120bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n123in/60in/28in to scuttle\nWHEELBASE\n88in\nWEIGHT\napprox.1125lb /510kg\nThe Three-7 was a very sophisticated design, with a\nstrengthened Lotus 7 Series 2 chassis, Elite-based five-link\nindependent rear suspension and differential, double-\nwishbone front suspension, disc brakes all round (inboard\nat the rear), 13-inch diameter magnesium alloy ‘wobbly\nweb’ wheels and a dry-sump, 1499cc Cosworth- Ford\n116E engine, producing a very healthy 120bhp at\n6500rpm. There were front cycle wings, Perspex curved\naero-screens and a tight fitting tonneau cover.\nThe prototype was exhibited at the 1965 Racing Car\nShow (left) and attracted a lot of interest. Specification\nsheets were issued showing a price tag of £1350 in\ncomponent form, or £1425 fully-built up, for export\nonly. But the decision had already been made to drop\nthe model as a production proposition on grounds of cost.\nThe inevitable official announcement followed shortly\nafterwards: “Because of an increase in orders for the\nracing Lotus Elan S2 and the Special Equipment\nFord-Lotus Cortinas, the Three-7 has not yet gone into\nproduction.” That remained its production fate and\nthe prototype was the one and only Three-7 ever built.\nNot having even moved under its own power, the\nprototype lay forlornly at Lotus Components, before John\nBerry, Home Sales Manager of Lotus, asked if he could\nhave it in lieu of his sales commission. There was plenty\nof work to get the set-up working properly but when he\nfinally appeared with the Three-7, the car was\nimmediately successful, becoming the car to beat (above)\nfor several seasons.

While Colin\nChapman was busy attending the Tasman\nChampionship, Len Terry was called on to do\nthe design work for a revised Indy contender,\nthe Type 38, on which the chassis was for the\nfirst time a full ‘stressed-skin tube’ monocoque.\nThe chassis frame was considerably stiffer than any previous Lotus single-\nseater, hopefully offering somewhat more crash protection for the driver\nshould there be contact with the unforgiving wall at Indy, but it still weighed\nonly 130lb. The chassis contained a rear mounted fuel reservoir tank fed by\nthree separate inner diaphragms forming the fuel tank bays, two full length\nones each side and one behind the seat; this allowed fuel capacity to increase\nby 40 percent with no expansion in terms of overall width or height.\nThe 38’s shape was much smoother than the 1963 and 1964 cars, with no\nabrupt change of section at any point. An increase in length of six inches\nwas accounted for by the longer nose, and the track was slightly wider at 60\ninches, with the monocoque still offset to the left-hand side. Underneath, the\nrunning gear remained much as before with the exception of the adoption\nof larger, ventilated disc brakes, and modified suspension geometry.\n1965\nIndycar\nType 38\nMilestone Car\n“It was finished on time, and once we got to Indy there was nothing\nto do. We’d just push it out each day, Jimmy would go faster yet,\nand we’d put it away again.”\nDave Lazenby\noverstressed new Hethel works, Abbey Panels of\nCoventry built these cars but used an ordinary\ngrade soft aluminium, rather than the high-tensile\nalloy used by the team. The two chassis (38/5 and\n38/6) were subsequently dubbed ‘Soft-Alloy\nSpecials’ and despite major reworking never\nreally approached the rigidity needed for racing,\nultimately proving un-successful.\nIn the 1966 Indy 500, AJ Foyt’s Type 38\nwas all but demolished in a massive start-line\npile-up, while Clark’s red STP sponsored car\nled for much of the race, despite an oversteer\nproblem caused by too much front end grip.\nIndeed, Clark thought he had won the race,\nbut then discovered that Graham Hill’s Lola had\npassed him during an early spin during in which\nhe had miraculously avoiding hitting the wall\nand, after much debate he and the team were\nconvinced they should accept second place behind\nHill. There was still life in the Type 38 though, as\nBobby Unser proved by finishing second at the\nMount Fuji race in Japan in October 1966. The\nfollowing year, with the new BRM H16-powered\nType 42 cars proving problematical, Clark again\nraced a Type 38 at Indy. Once again the Lotus Indy\nchallenger would be seen in the red colours of\nsponsor STP\n. Clark however was forced to retire\nwith a collapsed piston, ironically the same\nproblem that befell Hill in the new longer\nwheelbase Ford-powered Type 42F (see page 70).\nBy then most of the opposition had adopted\nthe Type 38’s construction principles, and the\nfield began to resemble a host of Lotus cars.\nThe significance of the Type 38 on\nthe American racing scene had\nbeen weighty indeed.\nThe latest incarnation of the fuel-injected Ford\nV8 engine developed 500bhp, but the difference\nwas that it was now fuelled by alcohol rather than\npump fuel, as in the last two Indy appearances.\nAs alcohol engines run cooler than those on\npetrol, a smaller radiator could be used. Another\nchange was the tyres: with a coy succinctness the\nLotus press release simply stated: “Tyres this\nyear will be Firestone.” The Dunlop fiasco was\nburied and forgotten.\nThe Type 38’s first appearance was to be at\nTrenton in April 1965, but in testing, the American\ndriver Roger McCluskey completely destroyed\none car against a wall when its throttle jammed\nopen. Team Lotus decided not to contest Trenton\nand instead headed straight for Indy.\nThe importance which Chapman attached to\nthe ‘500’ can be judged from the fact that Team\nLotus missed the Monaco GP in favour of racing\nat the ‘Brickyard.’ Dan Gurney was not with the\nteam that year – he raced in a Yamaha-backed\nType 38 under the Gurney/Shelby All-American\nRacers banner – so Chapman signed up stock\ncar veteran Bobby Johns to accompany Jim Clark\n(who was almost persuaded not to attend because\nhis mother was so worried about the dangers\nof the event).\nLotus cars were absolutely dominant in\nqualifying. The first five places on the grid were\noccupied by Lotus cars, including the Type 38s of\nClark and Gurney on the front row, alongside the\nexperienced AJ Foyt in last year’s Type 34 on pole.\nJim Clark, driving 38/1 (seen on the left with\nColin Chapman) led virtually all the way from the\nstart, only being headed by Foyt for nine laps and\ncame home to win with a standing ovation from\nthe 350,000 crowd. Much to Colin’s delight, a truly\nhistoric victory by a jubilant Team Lotus was\nrewarded by the $150,000 prize money.\nClark was undoubtedly helped by the\nprofessional pit stop work of theWood Brothers\nstock car crew, who performed the two pit stops\nrequired in extraordinarily quick time. He had\naveraged a speed of 150.686mph – a new record.\nHaving been fully restored by Classic Team Lotus,\nchassis 38/1 now resides in the Henry Ford\nCollection in Detroit.\nLotus Components sold two customer Type\n38s, one to AJ Foyt and another to Mario Andretti’s\nsponsors, for $22,500 each.

The choice of a new type number\nreflected the different perceived market for the new car,\nsince the S3 was launched initially in fixed-head form\nonly, and throughout the production life of the Elan, the\n36 type number was reserved exclusively for the fixed-\nhead variant. This was to be a more comfortable, civilised\nElan, equally capable of long distance travelling as well\nas tackling sharp corners in the usual Lotus fashion.\nThe major difference of the Series 3 was, therefore,\nthe fixed glass-fibre roof. This was quite unlike the\nremovable hardtop available on drop-top Elans, with a\ndifferent profile designed around new framed windows\nwhich sloped towards the rear (the S1 and S2 Elans had\nframeless windows). The screen was larger, too. Later\nin its production life, the fixed hardtop also incorporated\nventilation outlet grilles on each side behind the side\nwindows. This was part of the through-flow ventilation\nsystem that the team at Cheshunt had been trying to\nperfect for quite a while.\nThere were other exterior changes. The boot-lid was\nextended all the way back to include the rear lip. This\nmeant that the boot twist lock could be placed on the\nvertical tail panel above the number plate rather than\non the top panel as on the Series 1 & Series 2. This also\nhelped with the dispersement of rain water which had\npreviously been finding its way into the boot area.\nCentre-lock wheels became virtually a standard fitting\nas most owners preferred them, and the battery was\nrelocated, now mounted in the fully-carpeted boot rather\nthan in the passenger compartment behind the seats.\nMore significantly though, the interior was treated to\na healthy dose of refinement. Rubber-backed deep-pile\ncarpets, new door trims with armrests and more\ncomfortable seats made the Elan experience more\ncosseting, while the awkwardness of the push-pull\nsliding windows was solved by installing electric\nmotors, housed in the doors.\nThe Elan had made a big splash as a driver’s car\nalmost beyond compare. For sheer cornering\npower, acceleration and driver involvement it\nwas in a class of its own: as the advertising from\nLotus proclaimed, it “handles like nothing else\ncan.” As a sports car it was an undoubted\ntriumph, but there was some criticism of its crude\nspecification. Lotus realised that some potential\ncustomers were being put off by the down-to-\nearth nature of certain aspects of Elan ownership.\nSince the demise of the Elite, Lotus had no\nclosed GT model, which was a serious omission.\nMODEL\nType 36\nNAME/FORMULA\nElan fhc Coupe\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1965-68\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nApprox. 1200\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus-Ford Twin-cam\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1558cc/105bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n145in/56in/45.5in with roof\nWHEELBASE\n84in\nWEIGHT\n1520-1574lb/689-714kg\nElan Coupé\nType 36\nIn January 1966, the Special Equipment package was\noffered for the S3 as well as the existing S2 convertible.\nThis consisted of a 115bhp engine, close-ratio gearbox,\nservo-assisted brakes, centre-lock wheels, a leather\ntrimmed steering wheel and side repeater flashers on\nthe front wings of ‘most’ of the cars produced.

Ultimately\nit too would suffer from a difficult and much maligned\ncompetition career, largely due to its somewhat rushed\ndevelopment at the end of the 1965 season, insufficient\npre-race testing as well as a general lack of resources\nat Cheshunt.\nThe ‘tuning fork’ backbone chassis was stiffened,\nand the suspension was revised in an effort to improve\nupon the Type 30’s notorious handling. The Type 40\nwould start the season at Austria with the old 289 cubic\ninch Ford V8 and ZF gearbox, but thereafter, finding\nthe car seriously underpowered against the competition,\nLotus fitted a larger 351-cubic inch (5754cc) Ford V8\nengine. Developing around 410bhp this was mated to\nthe tough Hewland LG500 combined five-speed\ngearbox and final drive, in place of the earlier\noverstressed ZF unit. The bodywork was similar to the\n30’s, differing most notably in its rear cut-outs for a pair\nof upward-angled exhaust megaphones, a new rear\nspoiler and a slightly longer nose. Other changes\nincluded a repositioned oil cooler, slightly larger\n11¼-inch ventilated disc brakes and twin fuel fillers.\nTeam Lotus took a single Type 40 to the bumpy\nZeltweg Aerodrome for the car’s debut at the Austrian\nGP meeting; this was August 1965 and, although it was\nquite late in the season, the car was patently not ready\nfor a full racing programme. Despite the shortcomings,\nMike Spence took pole position, with a lap time some\n2.1 seconds inside Dan Gurney’s F1 record, and led for\n13 laps before an overheating engine forced him out.\nThe car had frankly been a handful in the race and\nclearly needed sorting. Some urgent work at Cheshunt\nsaw a revised, Type 40 delivered to the International\nGuards Trophy at Brands Hatch on 30th August with\njust five minutes of practice time remaining (right). On\nthis occasion Jim Clark was the driver but he too had\na hard time in the car, spinning twice in his first heat\n(before retiring with gear linkage problems), and then\ncrashing out when the brakes failed in heat two.\nEvidently the Type 40 was still a bit of a handful!\nTeam Lotus then took the 40 to the USA, Clark and\nAmerican driver Richie Ginther being the works pilots\nin a single event in the West Coast series, the Los\nAngeles Times Grand Prix. At Silverstone, test driver\nJack Sears ran comparison tests between the progressive\nDunlop tyres and the more grippy Firestones. During\ntesting he rolled his car after colliding with a bank and\nwas so badly injured that he missed the 1966 season\nand effectively retired from racing. In the Riverside race\nitself, Clark mustered a second place, some nine seconds\nbehind Hap Sharp’s Chaparral, while Ginther retired\nearly with transmission problems. Nevertheless, Clark’s\nsecond placing stands as the Type 40’s best result in\na year dominated by stiff competition from the\nMcLarens and Lolas.\nThe third and final Lotus 40 was the pale blue\nHolman & Moody car of A.J. Foyt. This car was\nwrecked in practice at Riverside by Holman &\nMoody mechanic and test driver Bob Tattersall.\nThe team managed to rebuild the car in time for\nthe Bahamas Speed Week in Nassau, but it had\ntoo-soft suspension settings and the car\nreputedly “fell to pieces” on the bumpy track.\nThe 40 had something of an evil reputation\nwith its drivers. Jack Sears called it “hard work\n– a very highly-strung and twitchy car.” And\na contemporary report even cited that Jim\nClark was heard muttering some very\nunkind things about the untested car. Lotus\nComponents put its two works cars up for\nsale in April 1966 at £3750 each, fully\nrace-prepared. Over the next few seasons\nnobody felt the Type 40 could be made\ncompetitive and their racing potential was\nnever fulfilled, today the Type 40 is an often\noverlooked chapter in the history of Lotus.\n\nType 40\n"

In\naddition, weight was not usually a factor, as many cars\nwere having to add ballast to get up to the minimum.\nFor 1966, Lotus decided to revert to the tried and\ntested steel tubular spaceframe for its new Type 41. This\ncar was built for Formula 3 applications, in addition to\nFormula Libre and US Formula B specifications. Original\npress releases stated that the Type 41 would also be\nproduced for Formula 2 for 1966, but Lotus went on\nto produce the monocoque Type 44 instead!\nAustralian John Joyce was given the design assignment,\nassisted by Dave Baldwin. It has been said that the chassis\nwas a development of the 22/31 frame, but a side-by-side\ninspection shows that Joyce started with a clean sheet of\npaper. The most notable feature of this new design was\nthe extensive use of stressed steel panels in the bulkheads,\nwith welded steel around the footwell, double-sided\nsteel around the instrument panel, welded sheet steel\nsurrounding the driver’s shoulder, and a double-sided\nsteel cradle surrounding the gearbox. Floors were also\nwelded in for additional stiffness. In usual Lotus fashion,\nwater and oil were carried in the main chassis rails\nbetween the engine and radiators. A very clever system\nwas devised to use the rear bulkhead as an oil overflow\ncollector. Even the front oil tank had its overflow routed\nthrough a labyrinthine path using chassis tubes, all the\nway to the rear end.\nSuspension was fairly typical Lotus design, with one\nmajor difference: it was wider than normal. The A-arms\nwere lengthened, producing a stance more reminiscent\nof an F1 car of the day. Type 33 six-spoke, six-bolt\nmagnesium wheels were used in 7-inch and 9-inch widths.\nIn early production, the rear uprights from the Type\n22/23 were used, but later on, wider stance components\nunique to the 41 were fitted. The Type 41 also boasted a\nreduced frontal area due to the smaller radiator and very\nsleek wind-tunnel-tested bodywork; these conspired to\nmake the cockpit considerably more cramped than the\nprevious Formula Junior and Formula 3 models.\nMost customers in the first year opted for the\nCosworth MAE engine, driving through a Hewland Mk6\n4-speed gearbox. The gear lever was on the right-hand\nside and proved to be very difficult to operate due to the\nchassis reinforcing tube that interfered with the lever,\nas well as the confined driving position. In a (rather\nineffective) design change after the 1966 season, this\ntube was sectioned and routed downwards, and then\nback up to give some room for the shift lever to move.\nThe official works F3 team for the 1966 season was\nCharles Lucas Team Lotus, the drivers being American\nRoy Pike and Piers Courage (see left). In the very first race\non Boxing Day 1965, Courage scored an impressive win,\nand the three Type 41s entered came in first, third and\nfourth. Courage would go on to take the Craven ‘\nA\n’\nChampionship in France. Other drivers with good\nresults in 1966 were American driver Peter Revson,\nDerek Bell and Mo Nunn.\nHowever, the season was dominated by the Brabham\nBT18, which led to the conclusion that the Type 41 was\nnot on par; but the records show that good results were\ncommon in races where there was a serious privateer\nteam present. The trouble was the relatively small number\nof entrants choosing the 41 compared to other marques:\nonly 28 cars were completed in 1966, with some of those\nbeing hillclimb and US specification cars. The 41 was\ncompetitive when properly prepared and competently\ndriven, but drivers hinted that it could be much more\ndifficult to set up than a Brabham.\nThe Type 41 continued on in 1967 as a F3 customer\ncar in Europe, but its largest market would be the growing\nUS Formula B series. The Type 41C cars (see below) as\nthey were officially called on sales sheets supplied by Lotus\nComponents, were usually fitted with the Lotus Twin-cam\nand mated to the new Hewland FT200 five-speed\ngearbox. Other minor changes were made, including\nalterations to the suspension geometry and the fitting of\n8 and 10-inch wheels to accommodate larger tyres.\nFormula 3\nType 41\nAfter the near disaster of the ‘flexible’ Type 27\nFormula Junior car and the mixed success of the\nTypes 32 and 35, Colin Chapman and others\nwithin Lotus began to question the suitability of\na monocoque chassis for the lower formulae.\n68"

Although several different types of\nBRM built engines were seen in racing, no BRM\nTwin-cam engines were ever officially installed in\nLotus road cars that came off the production line.\nThe BRM engine did however, find its way into an\nofficially sanctioned, dealer version of the Series 3 Elan.\nBuilt in very limited numbers by official Lotus dealer\nMike Spence, these cars were recognisable by their dark\ngreen bodywork accentuated by bright orange bumpers\nat both front and rear. Under the bonnet the major\nfeature of the car, the re-worked Twin-cam engine could\nbe identified by a dark racing green cam-covers stamped\nwith the words ‘BRM Racing’. The concept of the\nup-rated Twin-cam engine did of course re-surface\na number of years later as the ‘Big Valve’ engine fitted to\nthe ‘Elan Sprint’ series of cars.\nThe Series 3 convertible (which from June 1966, was\nalso available in the same Special Equipment form as the\nCoupé) continued pretty much without major change\nuntil March 1968, when it was replaced by the Series 4\nconvertible (still retaining the Type 45 designation). Both\nSE versions of the Series 3 car (coupé and droptop)\nfeatured fitted carpets in the cockpit and boot areas,\ninertia reel seatbelts as well as a padded leather rimmed\nsteering wheel. The final drive ratio on the SE was\nchanged to 3.55:1, rather than the previous 3.77:1 in\norder to offer more comfortable and relaxed high-speed\ndriving, and the whole SE package added £163 to the\nbasic price of £1,262 in component form or £1,553\non the fully built option.\nThe 45 type designation was reserved for the drop-head\nversion of the Series 3 Elan. This arrived in June 1966,\nsome nine months after the fixed-head Coupé (Type 36)\nfirst appeared. The Type 45 superseded the Series 2\ndrop-top (Type 26) which had continued alongside the\nSeries 3 coupe until that point.\nIn almost all respects, the S3 convertible followed\nthe specification and changes of the S3 hardtop coupé. In\ngeneral the Series 3 and then the Series 4 Elans continued\nwith Lotus’ intention of making the car a more refined\nvehicle with enhanced levels of comfort and equipment.\nSignificantly, this meant that there were now electric\nwinding windows in fixed frames, unlike the frameless\npush-pull grip affairs of the S1 and S2 cars. The new\nwindows subtly altered the profile of the leading edge of\nthe doors while a new design of soft-top and framework\nhelped make the ‘Drop Head’ name a more easily\nworkable reality.\nOne more indication of the more ‘touring’ nature of\nboth versions of the S3 was the option of a different axle\nratio for more relaxed high-speed cruising, rather than the\nstandard final drive. When the higher ratio was chosen, it\nwas mated to a close-ratio Lotus Ford gearbox with lower\nfirst and second gearing to maintain similar acceleration\ntimes. Some people thought the Elan would have\nbenefitted from a five-speed gearbox, but that was still\nseveral years off.\nDuring 1965 an agreement was reached between\nLotus and BRM concerning the production of racing\nversions of the Twin-cam engine. The intention was for\nthe Bourne firm to build a series of engines to be used\nin the Cortina and Elan, as well as in the lower formulae\nsingle seater categories such as Formula 2 and Formula 3.\nElan Series 3 dhc\nType 45\n"

Unfortunately, that year Lotus would always be\nstruggling in Formula 2, as it was up against the dominant\nBrabham-Hondas, who, with the high revving advanced\nJapanese powerplant installed were virtually invincible.\nThe season began with Ron Harris-Team Lotus\nrunning its old Type 35s, but at Barcelona the Type 44\nmade its debut with Jim Clark at the wheel. Essentially it\nwas an evolution of the Type 35, with its monocoque hull\nmodified to accept wider 41-type suspension. The nose\nand tail body sections were grafted on from the Type 41,\ngiving the new Type 44 a wider, lower profile which many\nregard as one of the most graceful of all the Lotus types.\nAt the front end, Lotus kept the system of inboard\ncoil-spring/damper units and upper rocking arms. But the\ntrack was much wider, achieved by lengthening the upper\narms and the lower wishbones. Likewise, the rear end was\ncarried over much as before, with reversed lower\nwishbones, top links, twin radius arms and coil-spring/\ndamper units – again the track was wider at 54 inches,\nsimilar in the majority of cases to the earlier Type 41.\nLotus stuck with the 997cc Cosworth SCA engine.\nIn fuel-injected form it may have developed a very\nimpressive 140bhp, and was capable of revving right up\nto a screaming 11,000rpm, but it was frankly no match\nfor the superb Honda engine in the Brabham.\nThe first race for the new Type 44 at Barcelona was\nnot particularly auspicious by any means. Jim Clark’s\nCosworth engine caused problems and early retirement.\nHe then missed a substantial part of the mid-season\nFormula 2 series but made a return at Karlskoga and\nKeimola, scoring a pair of creditable third places behind\nthe Brabham-Hondas. Perhaps the best result of the\nseason was at Montlhery, where he finished second\nbehind one of the Brabhams.\nWhile Jim Clark fought valiantly in the team’s number\none car, some nine further drivers raced a second official\nworks Team Lotus Type 44 through the 1966 season -\nPeter Arundell, Trevor Blokdyk, Piers Courage, David\nHobbs, Eric Offenstadt, Pedro Rodriguez, Mike Spence\nand Picko Troberg all tried their hardest, but since Clark’s\ntalents made little impact in his own car, it is unsurprising\nthat precious little success followed in the wake of the\nteam’s other entries. Peter Arundell scored the best\nperformance of the other drivers, finishing second to\nJochen Rindt’s Brabham in the Eifelrennen race.\nThe Type 42 would be a development of the Type 38, but\nessentially a new ground-up design. The new chassis was\ndesigned around the proposed 3.0-litre Formula 1 BRM\nH16 engine, and was truncated to accommodate the\nengine’s role as a load-carrying suspension member. The\nrunning gear was very similar to the 1965 set-up, and\nusing aluminium alloy and sheet steel of various gauges,\nthe complete structure weighed only 80lb. The body\nlooked sleeker than before and overall the car was\ndesigned to be a lot stiffer than the previous years.\nIt was intended to use a 4.2-litre version of the\ncomplex BRM H16 engine, a power unit being developed\nfor use in Formula 1, with an intended power output of\nno less than 650bhp! Lotus actually ran such an engine\nin prototype form in the Type 42 at Snetterton, with a\nthree-speed BRM gearbox, but it expired after a few laps,\ntestament to the fact that the H16 was plainly unready\nfor racing. As such, Lotus was forced to fall back on the\nType 38 for Indy in 1966.\nFor 1967, one of the two Type 42 chassis built was\nresurrected and cobbled up to accept the Ford V8\nquadcam engine and a ZF two-speed gearbox. This\nmeant designing a new tubular spaceframe aft of the\ntruncated monocoque to mount the engine and, since the\nV8 was far longer than the BRM H16, the wheelbase was\nextended by no less than ten inches. Another compromise\nwas the fuel tank capacity: since there were originally no\nrear chassis legs to carry extra fuel, there was a sizeable\ntank behind the driver. Surprisingly, the extra length\nseemed to have a beneficial effect on handling.\nThe revised chassis was called the 42F\n. At the 1967\nIndy 500, Graham Hill only managed to qualify 31st on\nthe grid (below) and in the race, a failed piston after 23\nlaps forced him to drop out. He was classified 32nd. As\nJim Clark in a Type 38 was classified only one place\nhigher, the whole episode can be regarded as disappointing\nin the extreme. Chapman himself described the 42F as\nAfter three years working with Lotus at Indy,\nFord had signed with the All-American Racers\nteam of Dan Gurney, so Colin Chapman was\nforced to look elsewhere for a partnership deal.\nHe found it in Andy Granatelli (of STP fame),\nand a new STP-Lotus partnership was formed\nwhere, after working on the still-born Formula 1\nType 39 Tasman car, Maurice Philippe’s first\nbig job was to design the BRM H-16 powered\nType 42 Indianapolis challenger for 1966.\nMODEL\nType 42 & 42F\nNAME/FORMULA\nIndycar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1966-67\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2\nENGINE TYPE\nB.R.M.

        "content": "In the year before the brilliant new Cosworth DFV would\nappear, Colin Chapman opted for BRM’s H16 engine.\nThis somewhat troublesome powerplant was, technically\nspeaking, very interesting. BRM essentially joined two\n1.5-litre V8 units together one on top of the other, with\nthe angle of the vee opened out to 180 degrees to create\na 16-cylinder engine arranged in an ‘H’ pattern. The\ncrankshafts were then geared together.\nThe H16 engine was therefore very compact, if\nrather heavy and Team Lotus knew that they were in for\na difficult season when the first engine arrived from BRM\nin a crate and it took four men to lift it off the truck! Its\ncrankcase was also designed to act as a stressed member:\nthe monocoque was truncated behind the cockpit and the\nengine/gearbox assembly was attached directly to the\nbulkhead, acting to take fairly substantial suspension\nloads. Double radius arms either side of the engine fed\ndirectly into pick-ups on the monocoque itself. The power\noutput of the dry-sump 3.0-litre engine was in the region\nof 400bhp, and it used individual exhaust clusters for\neach cylinder bank, plus distinctive induction boxes\nmounted low on either side.\nThe monocoque chassis was designed by Maurice\nPhilippe and in layout was what was essentially to become\nthe Type 49 in 1967. It had the usual Lotus features of\nseparate inner diaphragms to form the fuel tank bays and\nthere was an additional tank section behind the driver’s\nshoulders. The front suspension followed the practice of\nthe Type 33, with upper rocker arms, inboard Armstrong\ncoil-spring/damper units and unequal-length double\nwishbones, wide-based with inboard anti-roll control.\nAt the rear, a reversed lower wishbone attached under\nthe BRM six-speed gearbox, extensions of the cast hub\ncarriers joined up to single lateral top links pivoting on\nsupports mounted on the cylinder heads, and the coil-\nspring/damper units were attached forward of the axle\nline. BRD sliding-spline half-shafts had now well and\ntruly supplanted the rubber doughnut layout used on\nboth Lotus road and race cars for a number of years.\nThe first Type 43 was ready in time for Team Lotus\nnumber two driver Peter Arundell to take it around Spa\nin practice for the Belgian Grand Prix, but it only lasted\nfor three laps, and was well off the pace at that. The 43’s\nrace debut came at Reims in July, but Arundell suffered\nfrom gear selection problems and an early retirement.\nBRM subsequently modified its transmission.\nJim Clark moved up from the Type 33 to the 3.0-litre\nType 43 for the Italian GP at Monza (left), taking on\nArundell’s chassis (43/1). He had promising prospects\nafter qualifying on the front row of the grid, but made\na disastrous start which left him second-to-last. Lotus\nquoted the loss of wheel balance weights and a faulty\nbattery as the cause. He then charged through the field to\nget back to fifth place, but a puncture, and then a jammed\ngearbox, had scuppered his chances by the 59th lap.\nBetter fortune awaited at Watkins Glen in the USA.\nAlthough Clark’s engine expired in practice - typical of\nthe poor reliability of the H16 engine - he was able to\nstart the race with the BRM works team’s spare engine\non the front row of the grid. He succeeded in winning the\nrace and to score not only Lotus’ sole F1 win that season,\nbut a miraculous and solitary victory for the unreliable\nBRM H16 engine. The Type 43 re-appeared in Mexico\nbut once again suffered an engine breakage in practice,\nand then gear selection problems in the race itself.\nThe 43 was carried over for the first race of the 1967\nseason in South Africa. A second chassis was constructed,\nfor Graham Hill who joined Jim Clark at Team Lotus.\nClark raced chassis 43/2 but did not finish after a\ncatalogue of problems, including overheating and a\nthrottle malfunction. Hill managed to bend his car’s front\nsuspension, which led to a holed oil pipe. This was the last\nofficial outing for the Type 43, but the two cars were sold\non and fitted with Ford V8 engines in special tubular steel\nframes for use in the new Formula 5000. Jock Russell\nbought 43/1 and fitted a 4.7-litre Ford with Gurney\nheads, while 43/2 went to Robs Lamplough, who\ninstalled an FAV-built 4.7-litre engine.\nMODEL\nType 43\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1966\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2\nENGINE TYPE\nB.R.M.

        "content": "The backbone chassis was an adaptation of the Elan’s, having a Y-fork at\nthe rear to mount the engine and a simple but substantial cross-beam at the\nfront. The double wishbone front suspension was basically the same as that\non the Triumph Herald/ Spitfire, while the front hubs and discs were those\nof the GT6/Vitesse. The steering rack was a lengthened version of the\nElan/Herald unit. At the rear, and unusually for Lotus, substantial box-\nsection radius arms pivoted on the backbone where the Y-fork divided.\nDeep uprights carried coil-spring/dampers and the outboard ends of\nwide lower links; the fixed-length Hooke-jointed drive-shafts acted to locate\nthe wheels. A beam above the gearbox provided the location for the tops of\nthe spring/damper units. Braking was by Girling discs up front but there\nwere Girling 8-inch drums at the rear, which were not mounted inboard but\nmore conventionally near to the wheels; the wheels themselves were bolt-on\nearly Elan-style steel discs with chrome hubcaps.\nThe search for an engine with an integral transaxle led Lotus to Renault,\nwhich was amenable to supplying the all-alloy 1.5-litre engine and gearbox\nfrom its front-wheel-drive R16 model. Placing the engine in the centre of the\ncar and reversing the gearbox was all that was needed to take the drive back\nto the rear wheels. Modifications to Lotus’ requirements included a higher\ncompression ratio, bigger inlet valves and a twin-choke Solex carburettor, all\nfor a net output of 78bhp, nearly 20bhp more than standard. The choice of\nFrench mechanicals raised some eyebrows in Britain, but it was a sensible\nchoice considering the intended target market of the European mainland.\nOn the Series 1 car, the glass-fibre bodywork was bonded on to the\nchassis for strength, although this made repair and restoration nigh on\nimpossible. The styling was by John Frayling, and somewhat controversially\nincorporated a ‘breadvan’ rear end. The shape was exceptionally\naerodynamic – some sources suggest a Cd figure of 0.29, others 0.32.\nClever airflow forced air into the engine through the rear wheel-arches,\nwhile a front mounted radiator was fitted along with two electric fans\nto help the cooling.\nBecause the side windows had a double-\ncurvature, they had to be fixed in position and to\nget ventilation into the cabin, the front luggage\nbay was pressurised and forced air fed in via\nRenault butterfly nozzles in the dash. Although\nthe semi-reclining seats were fixed, there was\nsome pedal adjustment and a Triumph adjustable\nsteering column to help get the driving position\njust right. Luggage space was fair at 4.8 cubic feet\nin the nose and tail (a somewhat hot space).\nThe press was shown the ‘Europe’ in\nDecember 1966 and full production began in\nthe new year. The first five prototype cars had\nRenault R10/R16 indicator units mounted in\nMid-mounted engines had become the new\nstatus quo in racing, and the logical extension\nwas to produce central-engined road cars.\nRené Bonnet in France was the first to do so\nin 1961, but Lotus would not be far behind.\nFor the two years that the new mid-engined\ncoupé was being developed it was known by\nits factory designation of ‘P5.’ This was to be\nColin Chapman’s ‘Lotus for Europe’— a cheap\nroad-going sports car with all the handling of\na Grand Prix racer.\n1966\nEuropa\nType 46\nMilestone Car\n“It is in having the engine aft that the Europa is so special, Chapman\nhas been toying with the idea for years, and it is long overdue.”\nLJK Setright\nsemi-recessed openings below the front bumper\n(see above & right), but these were soon replaced\nby high mounted, inboard, side marker light units\nalongside the headlights. True to its name, the\nSeries 1 Europa was initially intended to only be\nsold on the continent but this of course was soon\nrevised to allow eager UK customers to buy into\nthe bold new style of Lotus.\nPress reports were enthusiastic about the\nunparalleled handling. The top speed was a\nmore-than-respectable 115mph but overall the\nchassis was capable of handling much more\npower (a criticism of course addressed by the\nlater Twin-Cam model). The Europa certainly\nhad its faults, including a very cramped cockpit\nwith poor pedal location, a very heavy clutch,\nimprecise gear changing and abysmal visibility\nto the rear. The Europa S1 was essentially a car\ninspired by racing practice and not ideal as a\nroad-going machine. Certainly it lacked the\nbroad appeal of the Elan.\nAs previously mentioned, initially Lotus\nannounced that the first 500 cars would be\nearmarked for French Lotus dealers only,\nand priced at 20,000 Francs each (which was\nconsiderably less than an Elan), but this was\nnever really the case. The Europa Series 1 chassis\nnumber sequence ended in 1968 at number 0644,\nwhen the Series 1 model was replaced by the\nmuch more sophisticated Series 2 car with the\nnew Lotus Type number of 54 (see page 86)."

These\nteam cars – designated 47A – were very different to their\npredecessors, with a body unit that was completely\ndetachable from the strengthened chassis. Much to John\nMiles’ displeasure the temperamental Tecalemit-Jackson\nfuel injection system was retained, despite the total loss\nby fire of the prototype car at Brands Hatch in 1967.\nThe revised car was still not only reliable but exceedingly\nquick as was shown by the ten new circuit lap records\nset during the 1968 season.\nFor 1968 the car theoretically became a sports car\n(rather than a GT) by reason of its homologation as a\nGroup 4 vehicle within Appendix J. The Gold Leaf\nTeam Lotus drivers for 1968 were once again JohnMiles\nand Jackie Oliver, with occasional appearances by Trevor\nTaylor and Tim Schenken. Miles won the 2-litre class in\nthe John Player Trophy race at Silverstone and came\nsecond in the International Trophy at the same circuit.\nOliver won his class in the Guards Trophy at Brands and\nagain at Croft. The 47 also scored many wins in club races.\nA total of 71 chassis were recorded as being built but\nonly the two 1968 team cars were designated as a Type\n47A (photographed here), although contemporary\nadverts implied that two others were built this has never\nbeen confirmed. Of the rest, seven chassis were\ndesignated 47Fs and fitted with Cortina engines and\nRenault gearboxes, and five were replacement chassis\nbody units.\nWhile the basic Europa chassis layout remained, it was\na more lightweight affair with a deeper front T-section\nand shorter rear Y-arms and welded box-section cross-\nmember. The suspension, too, was broadly similar to the\nEuropa’s, but at the rear end it incorporated new light\nalloy uprights from the Type 59, separate upper tubular\nlinks, reversed lower wishbones, longer upper and lower\ntrailing arms and full Rose jointing. At the front the\nfabricated upper wishbones were fully adjustable. Another\nchange was to abandon the fixed drive-shafts for rubber\ndoughnut inboard joints and outboard BRD universal\ncouplings. Girling brake discs were fitted to all four\nwheels, complete with an adjustable front/rear balance\nbar. Wheels were 13-inch, four-spoke Lotus centre-lock\nmagnesium alloys, with 7½-inch (later 8½-inch) front\nand 10½-inch (later 12-inch) rear rims.\nThe mid-mounted engine was the 1594cc Lotus-\nCosworth 13C double overhead camshaft unit with a steel\ncrankshaft, dry sump lubrication and Tecalemit-Jackson\nfuel injection, good for 165bhp. Private owners preferred\nWeber carburettors or, occasionally, Lucas injection.\nCooling was by a crossflow water radiator and separate\noil cooler, both mounted in the front compartment.\nTransmission was by Hewland FT200 five-speed gearbox\nwith limited slip differential. Twin alloy fuel tanks were\nnow fitted (behind the bulkhead) with a much more\nsatisfactory capacity of 20 gallons; there were quick\nrelease fillers on each side of the car.\nThe bodywork was lighter than the street Europa’s\nand would eventually feature NACA ducts behind the\ndoors, while the front arches were wider and flatter. The\ndriving compartment was functionally trimmed and\nincluded such standard features as a leather-trimmed\nsteering wheel, seat belt harness and fire extinguisher.\nLotus Components formed its own racing\nteam and scored a fair degree of success. At\nthe Type 47’s first appearance at Brands\non Boxing Day 1966, ‘number one’\ndriver for Gold Leaf Team Lotus John\nMiles finished first overall and went\non to win eight British events in\nthe 1967 season.

In the final he was running in an\nimpressive second place before mechanical problems\nrelegated him to eighth.\nOf the 25 Formula 2 races held in 1967, Brabham\nscored the highest percentage of victories, with eleven\nwins. Against this, Lotus countered with five victories,\nfour of them with the Type 48. Clark won three times\n(at Barcelona, Jarama and Keimola), while Jackie Oliver\nscored the fourth Type 48 F2 class win at the Nürburgring\nGerman GP event, coming home fifth overall. Amazingly,\nthis was the first-ever time he had been round the ‘Ring.\nHowever, for most of 1967, Oliver campaigned in\nFormula 2 under the Lotus Components banner driving\nthe well known black and white, uprated F3 Type 41B.\nJim Clark also scored a solitary second place at\nLimbourg, and thirds at Karlskoga, Hameenlinna and\nAlbi. Graham Hill had a less successful season but he\ngained several good placings: second at Snetterton,\nSilverstone and Reims, third at Helsinki and Oulton\nPark, fourth at Rouen, as well as other strong finishes at\nTulln-Langenlebarn, Karlskoga, Enna and Hameenlinna.\nAt the end of 1967 Lotus offered the Type 48 for sale\nto other teams at £5000, but a total of just four chassis\nwould only ever be built, including the ‘Team’ cars. As\nthere were no current Team Lotus F1 cars available in the\nUK (they were all on the other side of the world for the\nTasman series) the Type 48 was used for the launch of the\nnew Team Lotus sponsor package for 1968. Resplendent\nin the red, white & gold of Players Gold Leaf cigarettes,\nthe Type 48 had the distinction of being the car that\nstarted the sponsorship revolution that changed the face\nof motor racing.\nIn 1968 Gold Leaf Team Lotus continued to campaign\nthe Type 48, but the season started badly with Jim Clark\nbeing tragically killed at the wheel of the 48 at\nHockenheim in April. Graham Hill had no luck in the\neight events in which he competed that year, his race at\nCrystal Palace famously ending with a wheel falling off,\nbut Oliver came second at Hockenheim and took fifth\nplace in the championship for non-graded drivers.\nFor 1967 the F2 regulations were revised from the previous\n1000cc to accommodate engines up to 1600cc. The new\nType 48 employed a conventional chassis, with a full\nmonocoque centre section and a spaceframe aft of the\ncockpit which carried the engine, transmission and rear\nsuspension, much like the Types 42, and 43.\nPower was supplied by the 1599cc Ford-Cosworth\nFVA twin overhead camshaft engine, which had a 16-valve\nhead on a Ford block. The Cosworth engine was at that\ntime unrivalled for both power and reliability – it\nproduced approximately 220bhp on Lucas fuel injection\n– and even Brabham deserted its previously dominant\nHonda engines in it’s favour. Unlike the majority of\nother F2 constructors, who relied on Hewland FT200\ntransmissions, Lotus, after one sole outing with the old\nHewland Mk5 box, elected to use the all-synchromesh\nZF 5DS12 gearbox designed specifically for F2 racing.\nThe suspension followed the geometry of the F1 Type\n33; at the front end, fabricated cantilever top wishbones\noperated on inboard coil-spring/damper units; the\nbottom wishbone was wide-based, extending back well\ninto the cockpit area. The rack-and-pinion steering was\ntop-mounted with forward facing steering arms. At the\nrear end, the twin radius rods were anchored in the\nmonocoque immediately behind the driver, with the\npickup points for the inverted bottom wishbones and\nsingle top links, and the outboard-angled coil-spring/\ndamper units, located in a diaphragm section at the rear\nof the spaceframe. The inboard locating lugs for the\ninverted bottom wishbones gave trouble initially, but\nwere later strengthened by a bar between the two points,\nwhich transmitted the loads across the chassis.\nGirling alloy calipers were mounted outboard all\nround, tucked tightly within the magnesium knock-on\nwheels. Fuel was carried in rubber tanks alongside the\ndriver with the dry sump reservoir located directly behind\nthe oil and water radiators at the front of the car. The\n‘black box’ transistor ignition was mounted above the ZF\ngearbox in a special housing to keep it as cool as possible.\nThe Type 48’s debut came in the Tasman series at the\nAustralian Grand Prix at Warwick Farm. While Jim Clark\nstuck with his Formula1 based Type 33, Graham Hill\npiloted the prototype 48 and was running in third place\nwhen the crownwheel and pinion of the Hewland Mk5\ngearbox failed at around half-distance, the transaxle being\ninsufficiently strong for such a powerful engine.\nMODEL\nType 48\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1967-68\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nCosworth-Ford FVA dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1599cc/220bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149.5in/68in/30in\nWHEELBASE\n91.5in\nWEIGHT\n926lb/420kg\n1967\nFormula 2\nType 48\n"

        "content": "Few racing cars are as celebrated as the\nFormula 1 Lotus Type 49. Its racing record was\ncreditable and championship-winning, but that\nis not the real reason for its fame. That lies in its\nengine, for the Type 49 was the first car to have\nthe immortal Cosworth-Ford DFV V8 engine\ninstalled – the engine which would dominate\nFormula 1 for over a decade.\nColin Chapman was instrumental in bringing the DFV engine to fruition.\nAfter a change in the Formula 1 regulations, he needed a new 3.0-litre engine\nfor his forthcoming F1 car, and the BRM V8 and H16 engines used in 1966\nwere not altogether satisfactory. His long association with Cosworth –\nfounding partners Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth had met at Lotus in\n1957 – led him straight to their door. The trouble was raising the money to\ndevelop a new engine. Chapman managed to persuade Harley Copp, Ford\nof Britain’s Vice-President, Engineering, to make an initial investment of\n£100,000, as well as providing some specialist help. It was to be one of the\nbest investments by a major manufacturer in the history of motor sport.\nDuckworth’s first step was to design the FVA four-cylinder engine for\nFormula 2, as this would form the basis of a full Formula 1 V8 configuration\nengine. So the DFV engine was born: a compact 90-degree V8 with a stressed\ncrankcase, which developed a quoted 400bhp at 9000rpm.\nThe DFV evolved as a package with the Type 49 chassis, which was co-\ndesigned by Chapman and Maurice Philippe; as a result, the engine, gearbox\nand chassis were beautifully integrated and as light as feasibly possible - as\nLotus said, ‘a good deal less than a standard road going Mini.’ The engine\nacted as a chassis member, so that the monocoque became a simple nacelle,\nterminating immediately in front of the engine, which was carried on four\nmounting points. The low and narrow profile of the engine enabled the\noverall cross-section of the chassis to be kept to an absolute minimum.\nThe chassis contained three aircraft-type flexible fuel cells with a capacity\nof 40 gallons, feeding either to an engine-driven Lucas fuel pump or to an\nelectrically driven pump for starting. A tubular subframe at the forward\nend of the monocoque carried the front suspension, steering, brake master\ncylinders and so on; a reserve oil tank was carried over the driver’s legs.\nThe suspension was familiar Lotus design, but there were new features.\nAt the front, the top rocker arms were of deeper section yet considerably\nlighter. The cast magnesium uprights incorporated the steering arm and yet\nallowed the brake disc to extend outside the wheel profile, for better cooling.\nSteering was by rack-and-pinion, now mounted low down. At the rear,\ntriangulated tubular frames provided upper suspension pick-ups points on\nthe cylinder heads, and another frame under the ZF 5DS12 gearbox provided\nthe lower mounts. The transmission incorporated sliding-spline\njoints within the output shafts. The lightweight wheels were new,\ndesigned for the new, even wider section Firestone tyres that were\nnow available to the Formula 1 teams.\nThe first race for the new car was intended to be at the Monaco\nGP in 1967 but the revolutionary car finally lined up for its first\nrace on the 4th June 1967 at the Dutch GP held at Zandvoort. This\nwas certainly a spectacular debut.\nGraham Hill streaked away from\npole position but retired, leaving\nJim Clark to assume the lead,\nset the fastest lap and score\nboth the Type 49’s and DFV’s\nfirst win. Amazingly, the 49\ntook pole position for every\nGrand Prix event for the rest\nof the year, with Clark\nwinning three more races to\nfinish third in the Drivers’\nWorld Championship. Hill\nwas always very quick but\nlady luck eluded him and\nClark scored all of the Lotus\nF1 wins that season, including\nthe non-championship race\nat Jarama.\nOn the 1st of January 1968\nClark won his 25th – and final –\nGP victory in the Type 49 at\nKyalami in South Africa before his\ntragic death driving the Formula 2 Type 48 at\nHockenheim in Germany. Thereafter the Type 49s wore the red,\nwhite and gold colours of Gold Leaf Team Lotus, reflecting the\nteam’s new sponsorship deal with Players. At a time of crisis\nfor Team Lotus, Graham Hill won the second Grand Prix of the\nseason, the Spanish GP at Jarama (above), launching both\nhimself and the team towards World titles in 1968.\n1967\nFormula 1\nType 49\nMilestone Car\n“I think this new engine is going to win some GPs and,\nif we are lucky, we could even win the World Championship.”\nWalter Hayes\n78"

It was longer and\nfeatured pierced holes to reduce weight. The familiar\nfront and rear Y-fork arrangement remained, with\ncrossmembers carrying virtually identical suspension.\nThe differential was mounted under the rear cross-\nmember, located by torque arms attached to the main\nchassis and suspended by arms on the alloy casing; these\narms were initially insufficiently strong (because the +2\nwas some 315lb heavier than the Elan), and so a thicker\ncasting was soon substituted.\nBraking was by Elan-type discs but, for the first time\never as standard on a Lotus, a brake servo was fitted (and\ntwin servos in certain markets). The discs were protected\nfrom dirt by shields, and all road tests commented on the\nexcellence of the brakes. The wheels were 5½x13 pressed\nsteel discs with centre-lock fixings.\nFor power, the +2 stuck with the 118bhp, 1558cc\nLotus Twin-cam engine (the launch brochure\nconfusingly quoted both 105 and 118bhp!) always\nequipped with twin Weber carburettors.\nOnly some of the later +2S130 cars, as\nwell as Federal specification cars, used\nStrombergs, whilst the very last +2S\n130/5 cars used Dellortos.

        "content": "In 1967, a brand new racing formula intended for\nbeginners was introduced. The new Formula Ford\ncategory was for single-seaters powered by a Ford Cortina\nGT pushrod engine and fitted with narrow ‘road going’\nwheels and tyres.\nLotus was in a good position to satisfy demand for\nsuch a racer, and it dusted off the old Type 22/31\nspaceframe and developed it into the Type 51 specifically\nfor Formula Ford. This did call for some chassis changes\nhowever, specifically at the rear to make the Cortina\nengine fit. Formula Ford cars ran broadly standard 1.5-\nlitre Cortina GT engines, with single twin-choke Weber\ncarburation, which were lightly tuned to develop around\n80-90bhp. A 1600cc version of the Ford ‘Kent’ engine\nwas soon adopted, with the title FF1600.\nOtherwise the specification of the Type 51 was very\nfamiliar. The multi-tube spaceframe had a steel undertray,\nfabricated bulkhead and roll-over bar, and the suspension\nwas by unequal-length wide-based front wishbones and,\nat the rear, twin radius arms, wishbones and top links,\nwith outboard coil-spring/damper units and a non\nadjustable anti-roll bar at both ends. The brakes were\nGirling outboard discs (9¼-inch front, 9¾-inch rear)\nwith an adjustable balance bar, and the rack-and-pinion\nsteering featured a sliding adjustable column. As required\nby the regulations, the 3½-gallon capacity aluminium fuel\ntank was sited underneath the adjustable seat. As usual,\nthe bodywork was in resin bonded glass-fibre with a\nwraparound Perspex windscreen. The narrow steel wheels\nso typical of the formula were 5½J Cortina wheels at the\nrear and 4½J Elan wheels at the front, fitted with radial\nply road tyres (145/13 front, 175/13 rear). Overall weight\nwent up by 30lb compared to the F3 Type 31, to 910lb.\nLotus Components arranged with the Motor Racing\nStables driving school at Brands Hatch racing circuit –\nalready a very good Lotus customer – that it would\nmarket the new Lotus, which was sold at £955 complete\nand ready to race.\nFollowing an appearance by nine Jim Russell cars in\na ‘Libre’ race on June 11th at Snetterton, the first official\n‘Formula Ford’ only race was in July, on the 1.24-mile\nBrands Hatch short circuit, and as part of the BARC\nTrophy Races meeting. Of the twenty cars shown on the\npreliminary entry list, no fewer than ten were Lotus 51s,\nall of them Motor Racing Stables cars (a further five were\nJim Russell Racing Drivers School Lotus 31s). In his Type\n51, George Lewis led from pole but spun at Paddock\nBend, which left ex-serviceman Ray Allen in another\nType 51 to sprint ahead almost unchallenged to take the\nchequered flag. A trio of Lotus 31s came in next, followed\nby two other 51s – Peter Wardle in fifth and Edmund\nPatrick in sixth place.\nThat first race at Brands was pretty quiet compared to\nwhat followed, as Formula Ford became well-known for its\nrough-and-tumble antics. The most successful driver of\nthe 1967 season was Dan Hawkes, who drove a Motor\nRacing Stables Type 51 to victory in five of the season’s\nFormula Ford races.\nIn late 1967/early 68, a slightly modified model called\nthe 51A was offered to customers and again the Lotus\nMODEL\nType 51\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula Ford\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1967-68\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n200+\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cortina GT pushrod (later ‘Kent’ crossflow)\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1500cc, later 1599cc/80-90bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n152in/60in/33.5 to top of roll-bar\nWHEELBASE\n90in\nWEIGHT\n910lb/413kg\ndifferently to the Elan.

The boot was also much larger than the\ntwo-seater Elan’s. Later cars had a deeper boot due\nto a change from a transverse exhaust silencer to\na longitudinal unit.\nAs launched in September 1967, the +2 cost £1672\nin component form or £1923 including purchase tax\nfully built, although by January of 1968 this had become\n£1718 and £2113 respectively.

Indeed, the Type 51 was something of a sales success for the\nLotus Components branch of the company, with a grand total of 218 cars being built\n(though some sources suggest 150 or 165 cars). This was despite strong competition from\nother manufacturers. 51B and 51C models were developed, primarily for sale in the\nUSA. The ‘B’ featured updated and improved rear suspension with upper trailing links\nmounted to the top of the upright, while the ‘C’ models had a Hewland transaxle fitted.\nSome got the Mark 6, some the Mark 8.\nOne footnote to the Type 51 story is the curious 51R displayed at the January 1968\nRacing Car Show. This was a novelty exercise, devised as a publicity stunt by then Lotus\nsales manager Graham Arnold which attempted to turn the 51 into a road car, complete\nwith full lighting, cycle wings and a very sixties ‘flower power’ paint scheme.

        "content": "For the 1968 Formula 3 season, Lotus again rolled out\nthe successful spaceframe Type 41, this time with a new\ninteresting wedge profile and revised front suspension\ntaken from the Type 47 racing version of the Europa that\nfeatured unequal length wide-based wishbones with\noutboard coil-spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar.\nThe rear suspension, brakes and gearbox all remained\nthe same as on the 1966-67 versions of the car, with the\nwishbones, top links, and radius arms mounted on\nadjustable spherical bearings, outboard coil-spring/\ndamper units and an adjustable anti-roll bar.\nOfficially titled the 41X in the 1968 Gold Leaf Team\nLotus press releases, this car was intended as a test-bed\nfor a new Formula 3 car for 1969 season, which was to be\ndesignated the Type 55. This car was never actually built\nthough, and thus a permanent gap was left in the Lotus\nType number sequence.\nThe 1968 Formula 1 season would be the one that\nspawned the ‘high wing’ concept of aerodynamics, and\nTeam Lotus was quick in carrying this over to their lower\nformulae cars such as the 41X and the later Type 70.\nStarting the season in the F3 support race to the\nInternational Trophy at Silverstone, where John Miles\nMODEL\nType 41X (55)\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 3\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1968\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nHolbay-Ford\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n998cc/115bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n156in/66in/33in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n935lb/424kg\nwon easily, the plain red car had no aero appendages. By\nthe time the season got into full swing, the car was to be\nseen running in the controversial new Gold Leaf Team\nLotus colours, and with an adjustable high wing at the\nback, balanced out by front wings (without endplates) on\nthe front of the low, wide, almost pointed nose (below).\nAt some of the early races, the team ran an upswept\nrear body section that completed the sleek wedge shape\nreminiscent of both the 1968 Type 49B Formula 1 car\n1968\nFormula 3\nType 41X (55)\nand the Type 56 Indianapolis car. However, when the team changed from a single down-\ndraught Weber carburettor to a twin set-up, along with the high wing configuration, the\nengine cover that covered the 1000cc Holbay power-unit that was inclined 30-degrees to\nthe vertical, was discarded completely. The 115bhp engine put its power to the road\nthrough a single dry-plate 7.24-inch diaphragm clutch and a Hewland MkIV 4-speed\ngearbox. Wheels were 13-inch Lotus magnesium knock-on, 4-spoke with 7-inch front\nrims and 9-inch at the rear.\nWith John Miles driving the one-off Type 41X over the course of the season (seen\nabove at Brands Hatch) in just ten races, the car produced four major victories, several\nsecond places finishes, and a string of lap records.\nBy the final race of the year at Brands Hatch in December, however, it was apparent\nthat the Type 41 was falling off the pace of the Brabham, Tecno and even Merlyn chassis\nthat had been winning the majority of the races, and was nearing the end of its useful\nlife. Thus the Type 55 concept was shelved and a totally new design, the Type 59 was\npushed through for use in Formula 3 for 1969.\nIn early 1969 the 41X and a “complete set of spares” was advertised by Team Lotus\n(along with the works Type 47) for sale in Autosport. The highly distinctive car – the only\n‘works’ Formula 3 Lotus to use high wings – was sold to a competitor in Italy who raced\nthe car for several seasons before it fell into neglect. Discovered several years later by an\nItalian Lotus enthusiast, the car remains in Italy and has undergone a full restoration.\n"

Many\nof these changes were brought about by the need to\nconform to the safety and emission laws being\nintroduced primarily in the United States, including\nitems such as the rocker-type switches on the dashboard,\na collapsible steering column and the need for larger\nrear light units.\nShortly after the launch of the new model, a\nsignificant revision to the bodywork was brought on\nby a change in the engine bay from Weber to Stromberg\ncarburettors. This happened after Colin Chapman\ndiscovered that the Stromberg carburettor was\nsignificantly cheaper than the Weber units they had\nbeen using until now, as well as helping slightly with the\nextensive testing needed for emissions requirements in\nthe USA.

A change to negative earth electrics\nmeant the addition of an alternator rather than the\ndynamo seen on earlier positive earth vehicles.\nCompared to the rather stark Series 1, the S2 was\nquite luxuriously equipped, with a brand new straight-\ngrain polished wood-faced dashboard fitted with six\ngauges, speedometer and tachometer ahead of the driver,\nand ammeter, oil pressure gauge, water temperature\ngauge and fuel gauge in the dash centre, with the option\nof a Philips radio.

Finally, the Grand Prix style hammock seats\nbecame adjustable fore-and-aft, as opposed to the simple\nfixed affairs in the Series 1. This much-improved interior\nwould be carried over into the Twin-Cam from 1971.\nOver a year after its launch for export, the S2 was\nmade available for the first time in the UK in July 1969.\nInitially it was sold only in complete form at a price of\n£1667 with purchase tax, but soon a component version\nwas also made available to avoid the still applicable\npurchase tax, priced at £1275.\nFor 1970, the chassis number system would be\nchanged to an annual numbering basis (as were all\nother Lotus Types), and a slightly revised bodyshell\nincorporating a directly-bonded glazed windscreen and\nnew side lamp/indicator units, mounted in semi-recessed\nnacelles above the front bumper and inboard of the\nheadlights was introduced.

Lotus declined, but the idea evolved into a Type 47-\nbased project that found the name 47D through an\nunusual route.\nCertainly a unique project, the Europa 47D, was a\nvery special one-off car built by Lotus for the GKN/\nVandervell group of companies which were scattered\nthroughout the world, and who produced all manner of\nthings from nuts and bolts through to pig troughs, in\nplaces as far apart as Birmingham and Australia. One of\nthe companies within the group, Vandervell Products Ltd,\nhad built and raced the famous Vanwall Formula 1 Grand\nPrix cars with which Britain dominated the Grand Prix\nscene some ten years or so before, and Colin Chapman\nhad helped on the design of their most successful car.\nIn the United Kingdom, however, they were\nprincipally known as manufacturers of automotive\nequipment, and there were very few British cars supplied\nwhich did not contain a very large proportion of\ncomponent parts which had been made for the industry\nby one or another of the companies under the GKN\numbrella. It may therefore come as something of a\nsurprise to learn that this was the only complete motor car\nwith which the GKN group were ever associated with in\nterms of complete manufacture. Few industrial concerns\ncontributed quite so many components to an industry in\nwhich they did not build a complete product, and it was\nno doubt, to some extent with this in mind that the\noriginal project of the GKN 47D was conceived.\nStarting with a Type 47 racecar, the 47D as it was\nto become known, had the standard backbone chassis\nlengthened by three inches, and the rear Y-fork section\nwidened to accommodate the 3.5-litre, light-weight alloy\nRover V8 engine, along with an ex-Formula 1 ZF\ngearbox/final drive unit supplied direct from Team\nLotus. GKN supplied many of the components and later\nmodified the engine, boring and stroking it out to 4.4-litres\nso that the eventual power output rose to 292bhp. The\nengine/chassis combination provided an enormous\nnumber of problems which made this car not only one of\nthe most unusual, but possibly one of the most expensive\nroad cars ever built by Lotus! A smaller flywheel was\nmade by one of the companies under the GKN umbrella;\nobviously, it needed a smaller clutch. A smaller clutch,\nnaturally, would not easily cope with the power. Borg and\nBeck were consulted and co-operated to produce a special\none-off clutch for GKN: a special 7-inch twin-plate clutch\nwhich, naturally, then needed a different bell-housing.\nThis was fabricated from magnesium by Kent Alloys,\nanother GKN subsidiary company.\nMODEL\nType 47D\nNAME/FORMULA\nGKN Europa\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1968\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nRover V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3498cc/205bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n160in/64in/41in\nWHEELBASE\n94in\nWEIGHT\n1900lb/862kg\nEngine lubrication also needed considerable thought and a new sump proved to be\nnecessary. At one stage, the use of dry sump lubrication was considered, but this was\neventually rejected on the grounds of complication. A new sump was therefore duly\nfabricated, once again by Vandervell Products Ltd. and, with the engine fully assembled,\nthe whole thing was sent to Lotus to be installed in the chassis.\nFitting the engine and transmission installation to the chassis meant that the rear\nsuspension had to be revised; both the length and the position of the radius rods had\nto be altered, and with the engine around half a hundredweight heavier than the Ford\nTwin-cam unit which was standard on the Lotus 47, quite a lot of experimentation had\nto be carried out to achieve a satisfactory spring rate. It was eventually decided to use\na combination of soft springs and stiff, though adjustable, Armstrong dampers.\nAlthough the car became to be known as the GKN 47D, this is merely because this\nis the registration number which was eventually found for the car. Clearly, it had been\nhoped to register the car as GKN 1 but no such vehicle existed with this UK registration\nnumber. There is unfortunately no space in which to record the full degree of detective\nwork which went into the search for a suitable number once this information had been\nestablished, but eventually the number GKN 47 was tracked down to a tractor registered\nby a Sussex timber firm in 1942. Still more detective work established that the vehicle\nhad been broken up, which meant that the registration mark was no longer capable of\nbeing issued; a further complication, just in case this proved to be insufficient was that\nit was apparently not possible to transfer a registration from or to a goods vehicle!\nThere followed still more investigations. Eventually, the registration number GKN\n47D was traced to a moped motorcycle and this was ultimately exchanged and the car\nwas not only registered, but christened as well!\nAs a test-bed for various GKN components, the 47D also served as a useful show\nvehicle, and with a potential 180mph top speed and 0-100mph in 11.1 seconds it also\nprovided occasional transport for any GKN executives in a hurry!\nGKN Europa\nType 47D\n"

The\nshape of the vehicle, however, departed from established\npractice as the result of extensive tests to determine the\noptimum wedge shape for an open-wheeled single-seater\nof this sort. Scaled-down models in the wind tunnel had\ndemonstrated the importance of situating the air intakes\nproperly to pick up cool air at high pressure. Also, the\nwedge shape addressed the importance of eliminating\nall high-speed lift after earlier Lotus research had shown\nthat the lowest an Indycar ever sat was when it was\nnot moving.\nFour-wheel-drive was not itself new to Indycar\nracing; in the ’60s the P104 Novi had run in the ‘500’ with\npromise but without ever tasting victory, and the previous\nyear the Paxton-Turbocar of Parnelli Jones had actually\nled the race until a gearbox failure just ten miles from the\nfinish. Enthusiasm on the Indy circuit for the potential of\ngas turbines had thus been growing year on year to which\nend STP boss Andy Granatelli had signed a deal for the\nexclusive use of the Pratt & Whitney industrial turbine.\nTo meet the complex race regulations regarding gas\nturbine air inlets, it was planned to run a modified version\nof the 1959-designed Pratt & Whitney PT6 called the\nSTN6B-74 with a three-stage axial compressor and\nburning aviation grade kerosene fuel. Output naturally\nvaried with altitude and ambient temperature, but was\nof the order of 430bhp at 6,230rpm at sea level and\napproximately 70°F\n.\nThe competition from the rest of the field with their\n2.8-litre turbocharged cars was strong, but Chapman\nand Granatelli remained confident that even with its\nslight power disadvantage their four-wheel-drive car\nwould have the advantage through the corners. In\naddition, the weight penalty of the four-wheel-drive\nsystem would easily be offset by the elimination of\na conventional gearbox, as their system used Harry\nFerguson’s own integral transfer drive mechanism.\nSix cars were planned but only four would actually be\nbuilt, two to be campaigned under the Team Lotus-STP\nbanner with one spare, and the final car to be driven by\nan American driver for Granatelli’s own team. After an\ninitial test at Indy by Jim Clark, the cars were driven in\nthe 1968 race by Joe Leonard, the popular Art Pollard,\nand by Graham Hill who had won the race in 1966.\nLeonard took pole position with an hugely impressive\n171.599mph (a track record), and with Hill just a few\nMODEL\nType 56\nNAME/FORMULA\nIndycar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1968\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4 (including Type 56B)\nENGINE TYPE\nPratt & Whitney STN6B-74 PT6 Gas Turbine\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n15.999 sq.in Intake Annulus/500+ bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n174in/75in/32in\nWHEELBASE\n102in\nWEIGHT\n1350lb/612kg\n1968\nWith its Pratt & Whitney gas turbine powerplant\nand Ferguson four-wheel-drive, the 1968 STP\nsponsored Type 56 Indianapolis contender was\ndescribed by its creator, perhaps with some\njustification, as “undoubtedly the most\nprogressive development possible to meet\nthe increasing demands from motor racing.”\nIndycar\nType 56\n88"

Pollard had retired too,\nhis turbine also having died. In both cases the fault was\nthe same: failure of the fuel-pump drive. Ironically,\nwhile Lotus had requested to run with steel driveshafts in\nthe pump, the units’ manufacturer had fitted phosphor\nbronze items to the pumps on the other two cars, both\nof which had failed. Significantly, only Hill’s car (on which\nthe turbine had not failed) retained the steel originals.\nFor two consecutive years a gas turbine car had nearly\nwon the Memorial Day Classic, something the American\nauthorities were not in the least happy about.

        "content": "The confusing offshoots of a somewhat mysterious project\nput in place towards the close of the 1967 season, the\nobscure Type 57 (Formula One) and Type 58 (Formula\nTwo) cars were twin design studies, in fact built around\nthe one single monocoque.\nThe intention was to utilise deDion axles and\nsuspension located in a lightweight tubular frame chassis\nat both front and rear. At the rear this would be in place of\nthe traditional but comparatively heavy Lotus beam style\nof deDion axle, seen on earlier cars such as the Eleven\nand Twelve. It had never been used at the front end before.\nConfusingly, the Type 58 (below) was the first of the\ntwo cars to actually appear. It was designed by Martin\nWaide and built during 1968 to house a conventional\n1600cc Cosworth FVA engine. Shown in the new Gold\nLeaf Team Lotus colours – aside from later versions of\nthe Type 48 which raced in the Tasman Series, the first\ntime this striking livery had been seen – it was intended to\nbe tested by Jim Clark the week after his return from the\nHockenheim Formula Two race in April 1968.\nUnfortunately he never made that test and thereafter\nthe car’s history is less clear than it might have been.\nThe FVA engined car is known to have run in testing\nat Hethel with Graham Hill driving (left), and possibly\nat Snetterton with both Hill and John Miles behind the\nwheel. In Formula Two guise, the car was reported to\nhandle beautifully and predictably, but it was by any\nstandards too slow to be competitive. With a distinct lack\nof enthusiasm for Formula 2 within Team Lotus, the\nproject was dropped and taken no further in this form.\nInstead, later in the year, and substantially revised,\nthe solitary Type 58 chassis was completely rebuilt as a\nprototype, fully finished to Formula One specification,\nwhereupon it emerged as the Type 57 (above). With\na high tail-mounted, ducted radiator and clean wedge-\nshaped bodywork set off well by the red, white and gold\ntobacco sponsored livery, to a contemporary observer this\nsecond-generation car appears somewhat reminiscent of\nthe upswept rear and chisel nosed front of the earlier\nType 56 and subsequent Type 56B turbine cars. This rear\nradiator configuration would re-appear a year later on the\none-off Type 68 test-bed Formula 5000 car and then be\nmoved to the sides of the car to finally end up as the\ndefinitive Type 72 wedge-shape car of 1970.\nWith success in the popular Tasman Series as the main\nobjective, the car was then converted to take a 2.5-litre\nDFW version of the Cosworth DFV\n, similar to that fitted\nto the Type 49, and not as has been reported elsewhere,\na 3.0-litre or Coventry Climax power-unit. In this form,\nand as the officially unnumbered prototype Type 57, it\nwas photographed testing again at the company’s own\ncircuit in Norfolk, and once again with Hill behind the\nwheel, and with a ZF gearbox. However, the Englishman,\nwhile covering considerable mileage in the car, did not\napparently enjoy the Type 57 experience and so instead,\nboth he and new recruit Jochen Rindt took their Type\n49Ts ‘down-under’ to contest the 1969 Tasman series.\nThe innovative deDion concept was thus shelved and,\nalthough the car survived in its final form, it never ran\nagain, until over 30 years later that is.\nIn 1999 Clive Chapman at Classic Team Lotus made\nthe decision to rescue the car from the Lotus stores, where\nit had been languishing for over three decades and have\nthe car restored to its former glory and its place in Lotus\nhistory as the first true wedge profile car. Under the\npatronage of historic racers Malcolm Ricketts and Don\nHands, the car was put back to 1968 F2 specification\nand ran its first ever race at Brands Hatch in 2002.\nMODEL\nType 57\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1 (Tasman)\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1968\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cosworth DFV\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2995cc/425bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n152in/70in/31in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n950lb/431kg\n1968\nFormula 1 &2\nType 57 & 58\n90"

The\nnew head of Lotus Components, MikeWarner, wanted\nto develop a radically new Seven, but the board members\nat Lotus favoured an evolution of the existing Series 2.\nBy 1968 Ford had brought out a new power unit for\ntheir European range of cars and the faithful old 105E\nand 116E engines were now becoming difficult to source\nnew, in any reasonable quantity. The new 225E crossflow\nengine came in two sizes, 1598cc and 1297cc. and was\ninstalled in the Seven in standard form with a single\nWeber 28/36 progressive downdraught carburettor.\nThese units, producing 72bhp and 84bhp respectively,\nwere fitted to the last of the production of Series 2 cars\nfrom the beginning of 1968. Still retaining the Standard\n10 axle, this model was dubbed the ‘Series 2½’.\nThe old Standard Ten axle, which was weaker than\nthe Nash Metropolitan item used in the Series 1 Seven,\nwas not really designed to take the 100bhp now being put\nthrough it, especially as the method of location asked\na lot of the casing. In addition to this, the significant\nadvance of tyre technology in the 1960s had put\nconsiderably more strain on the half-shafts, so that from\nSeptember 1968 a new model incorporating the much\nstronger axle from Ford’s successful Escort Mexico was\nproduced. This was then the first Seven to have an all\nFord drive train.\nThe many ‘improvements’ that came with the new car\nincluded: black carpet, upholstery and trim instead of\nthe traditional red; a fuel filler on the outside of the body\ninstead of it being in the boot space; the luxury of a fuel\ngauge rather than the notched stick previously required;\ndirection indicators as standard equipment; both\nspeedometer and rev-counter in front of the driver rather\nthan the former being directly in front of the passenger.\nWith the Ford axle came the wider 5½ x 13-inch\nwheels from the Lotus Cortina and of course the new\nLotus Type 51 Formula Ford cars, which in turn could be\nshod with modern radial tyres. These wider wheels and\nwider rear axle meant that wider rear wings were required\nand this gave a more aggressive look to the back of the\ncar. Later during the production of the Series Three,\ncast aluminium wheels from Dunlop were offered as\nan optional extra (see yellow car below).\nIn the engine department, the new Ford crossflow,\nin its standard state of tune, did not excite a lot, as the\nengine in the previous model had produced as much as\n120bhp (Cosworth Mark IX). Holbay, the engine tuning\ncompany from Suffolk modified the unit by fitting a\nhigh-lift camshaft, a pair of twin-choke, side-draught\n40DCOE2 carburettors and a free flow manifold and\ncalled it the CFR1600. This gave the same power as\nthe previous ‘pre-crossflow’ unit in its highest state of\nroad tune. A new luxury model called the Lotus Seven ‘S’\nwith this engine and better appointments, even including\na radio, was displayed at the Racing Car Show of 1969.\nHowever with a price tag of £1600 fully assembled, it\ndid not promise strong sales potential and thus the show\nmodel was the only one made. Even so, according to\nthe factory records, CFR1600 power units were fitted into\nsome cars.\nAlthough production of the Series Three finished in\nNovember 1969, the remaining stock of cars and parts\nmeant cars continued to be sold well into 1970. All in all,\nabout 340 Series 3 cars were made in a period of around\njust fifteen months.\n"

Some felt that this change was due to the new Government taxation systems which would eventually do away with the Purchase Tax and bring in the new VAT tax, as well as the desire of Colin Chapman for Lotus to move up-market. He felt that offering \"Kit\" cars was not the image Lotus needed to move forward into a new era. Thus, in an attempt to push the car up-market (more luxurious and more appealing) all +2S cars would be factory built and assembled. This is probably also why the Elan part of the name was dropped from marketing, to help distance it from the component form Elan (in the UK market). Interestingly though, many cars that appeared to retain the \"Elan +2\" badge.\n\nIn the words of the Lotus Cars brochure produced for the launch, \"The Lotus +2S is for the discerning motorist who requires the renowned Lotus road-holding and performance coupled to an attractive two plus two body.

The +2S also included revised seats and centre console, a new dashboard layout which placed the rocker switches on a mahogany facia and auxiliary fog lights at the front end, set below the bumper on either side of the front grill. Proudly advertised as \"The car with no extras,\" and \"so few extras that it not worth printing a list,\" it is somewhat strange to note that factory options available included the following: Aluminium alloy wheels (Brand Lotus), tinted windows (either just the front windscreen, or all round), heated rear screen, rear seat belts and most importantly to some, a workshop manual. Previously the manual had only been available as a cheaply photocopied typewritten supplement to the workshop manual for a standard model Elan.\n\nWith this conscious decision to move up-market, the +2S also offered several practical enhancements to the comfort and reliability aspects of the new model rather than the minor cosmetic/mechanical aspects of any other sports car. The launch brochures were keen to push away accidents when in capable hands.\"\n\nThe Lotus +2 had certainly moved the company into a new market sector, and the +2S took things a step further.

Mosley subsequently retired\nfrom driving and went on to form March Engineering.\nRindt, however, met with greater fortune, debuting at\nThruxton over the Easter weekend of 1969. Just a matter\nof days after the new always immaculate dark green and\nsilver cars had been shaken down at Snetterton, Rindt set\nthe fastest lap in practice: 1 minute 13.2 seconds – more\nthan two seconds ahead of his nearest rival. Despite a\npuncture in his heat which put him towards the back\nof the grid for the final, he battled through the field\neventually overtaking Jackie Stewart’s highly competitive\nFrench Matra to score an excellent first-time victory for\nthe new Type 59. He was later to repeat the feat at other\nEuropean Formula 2 meetings, Pau, Tulln-Langenlebarn\nand Zolder, to rack up four good wins in just eight races.\nHill, meanwhile, fared less well at Thruxton, and, finding the slim cockpit too tight,\nsnagged his leg on the steering wheel. Catching his hand on this leg, he spun out at The\nComplex. The car was later modified by cutting the dash panel out and relocating it\nslightly higher to clear his thighs. Of his eight races, he won ahead of Stewart at Albi\n(where Rindt came third), his first Formula 2 win since his time with Brabham-BRM.\nBoth cars crashed out at Reims; and Hill was forced into retirement at the Nürburgring\nafter a suspension collapse. Hill also competed in the car at the 1969 Oulton Park Gold\nCup where once again his luck was out, retiring when the oil pressure gauge pipe burst.\nA variety of other drivers took to the cars as well, stepping in when Rindt and Hill’s\nFormula 1 commitments removed them from contention. These included Andrea de\nAdamich – later to race in Formula 1 for Ferrari – also Rolf Stommelen, Alan Rollinson,\nJohnMiles and Roy Pike. Between them they took a third and seventh at Vallelunga, fifth\nand seventh places at Hockenheim, and a fourth-in-class in the Formula 2 section of the\nGerman Grand Prix, with Stommelen at the wheel.\nThe Type 59 Formula 3 car employed conventional Lotus\ndouble wishbone style suspension, with bespoke cast\nmagnesium uprights at the rear and modified Triumph\nHerald uprights at the front. The minimalist bodywork\nwas glass-fibre and was distinguished by a slightly pointed\nnose with twin ‘nostril’ air intakes, although this was\nsubsequently modified to accept a variety of spoilers.\nPower came from a 997cc down-draught Holbay-Ford\nR68 allied to a combined Hewland 5-speed and final\ndrive unit, on which was mounted the car’s entire cooling\nsystem of tanks, pump and cooler. The upswept shape of\nthe engine cowling with its recessed air intake also helped\nto feed air through to the oil cooler.\nThis compact cooling system proved to be a source of\nproblems for the two Gold Leaf Team Lotus cars driven\nby Roy Pike and Morris Nunn, but as time progressed the\ncars were developed into superbly competitive machines,\nBaldwin’s excellent chassis enabling the more courageous\ndrivers to push the little cars ever harder. Pike and Nunn\nwere to take first and second at Mallory Park, while in\nanother 59, a newcomer from Formula Ford came in fifth.\nFor Emerson Fittipaldi it was his first Lotus drive. Weeks\nlater, and back at Mallory Park, he scored his first ever\nFormula Three win; soon another eight victories enabled\nhim to claim the championship title for the Type 59, with\nhalf the season still to run.\nAs Formula 3 entered its final year as a 1-litre Formula,\nGold Leaf Team Lotus continued into 1970 with the\nType 59. Dave Walker joined Bev Bond and the pair\nscored some notable successes. At the Silverstone\nInternational Trophy meeting, Walker, (seen here on the\nleft leading Bond) took a fine win. Bond, who led at the\nstart of the final lap finished third after spinning out at the\nfinal corner and crossing the line backwards.\nOne other variant in 1969, was the Type 59F created\nby Jim Russell at Snetterton to compete in Formula Ford\nand also driven by future World Champion Emerson\nFittipaldi. Following on from the success of this car, Lotus\nComponents constructed a limited number of cars based\non the Jim Russell Type 59. With modified suspension,\nnarrower wheels and revised nosecone, the car fully met\nthe Formula Ford regulations.\nFormula 2\nType 59B\n"

However, a car with a Cosworth modified twin-\ncam engine left the Cheshunt factory as early as March\n1965, bound for Australian dealer Leo Geoghegan, for\nuse in an Australian race series. Over the next few years\nseveral Series 2 owners had figured out how to install the\nTwin-cam engine into their cars, and in early 1969\nGraham Nearn took one of these cars to Hethel to show\nthe factory that it really could be done.\nLotus Components, rather than Lotus Cars took up\nthe challenge and made a production version based on\nthe Series 3 chassis and called it the Twin-Cam SS (Super\nSeven). The first of these cars, an ivory white show car\nwas displayed on the Lotus stand at the 1969 Motor\nShow at Earls Court in October of 1969 (above).\nThis was a different Seven indeed with plush carpeting\nand trim that included improved contour padded seating\nin grey PVC, engraved aluminium dashboard (including\nWorld Champion Constructors badge), rocker switches,\nsemi-flush rear lights recessed in to the mudguards, slatted\nSeries 3 SS\nSeven\ngrill and GKN ‘Brand Lotus’ alloy wheels. The Holbay\nmodified big valve Twin-cam engine produced 124bhp\nat 6200rpm giving the car scorching performance with\n0-60mph coming in just 7.1 seconds and a top speed of\n111mph. With all this power it was deemed prudent for\na new stronger ‘SS80’ chassis to be made, so, to increase\nchassis strength, triangulation was added both around the\nbottom of the engine bay and to the chassis sides. In\naddition steel side panels were welded directly to the\nframe. Something which was to become a feature of\nthe future Series Four model.\nDuring the show Graham Nearn took enough deposits\nfor another dozen cars to be made. However, at that price\nof £1225 in kit-form the Twin-cam SS was expensive and\nonly 13 would officially be built (with the strengthened\nchassis (painted grey) but without the steel side panels).\nWith the chassis # prefix ‘SC’ and suffixes ‘TC1 to 13’\nthey were not given consecutive numbering, but had all\nleft Lotus by the end of January 1970. Many other Series\n3 cars were of course modified by their owners to emulate\none of the most sought after Seven models."

Warner’s plans,\nthough, were more grandiose than just another\nrefettling of the existing Seven, which still looked\nmuch as it had when launched in 1957.\nThis would be virtually an all-new car, to be sold\nthrough an all-new dealer network to a much wider\npublic. Part of the plan was also to make the previously\nloss-making Seven cheaper to produce.\nWarner set Peter Lucas and Alan Barrett to work on\nthe new Lotus Type 60 in March 1969, and the prototype\nwas completed only seven months later. Lucas designed\na simple new spaceframe chassis with spot-welded flat\nsteel cockpit and engine bay sides plus a folded steel front\ncross-member. It was built by Arch Motors (with some\nadditional chassis by Griston Engineering).\nThe bodywork was drastically new. Stylist Alan\nBarrett created a longer and wider shape which eschewed\naluminium for self-coloured glass-fibre construction. The\nrear wings, scuttle and dashboard were integral\nmouldings, while the new-profile GRP wings and large\ntilt-forward bonnet were separate panels. All the GRP\nbodywork was built in-house by Lotus Cars which kept\ncosts down. Free-standing headlamps were supplemented\nby nose-mounted indicators (later moved to a more\nprominent position on the wings).\nMechanically, the S4 also took many new directions.\nThe rear axle remained Ford Escort but was now located\nby Watts linkages and a single triangulated arm for lateral\nlocation. As before there were coil/spring damper units\nfront and rear, but the front the suspension was based on\nthe Lotus Europa. Only the very earliest S4 models had\nno anti-roll bar fitted. Brakes were carried over but the\nsteering reverted to Burman rack-and-pinion.\nThe engines offered in the S4 were the Ford 1600\n(or more rarely 1300) units and the Lotus Twin-Cam\n(115bhp) and Holbay Big Valve Twin-Cam (125bhp).\nThe Ford 1300 unit was an awkward fit and indeed one\nof the chassis tubes had to be cut away to get it in! A Ford\nCorsair gearbox replaced the previous Cortina unit.\nDespite being heavier than its elderly predecessor, the\nSeries 4 returned an admirable top speed of between\n108mph and 116mph depending on which engine was\nfitted, while 0-60mph acceleration times for the 1600GT\nversion hovered around the mid-eight second range.\nPerhaps the most attractive feature of the S4 was its\ninterior. Notably more spacious, it featured better seats\n(adjustable on export models), improved sidescreens with\nperspex sliding panels and a moulded dash with no fewer\nthan six gauges fitted. There was even an optional\nhard-top, of which very few were ever built.\nThe factory presentation of the so-called Seven S4\nto the Lotus Board of Directors took place in one of the\nhangars at Hethel, and it may be stated with some\ncertainty that those present got something of a shock! The\npublic got its first taste of the Series 4 car at the Geneva\nMotor Show of March 1970.\nControversy followed the S4’s styling. Many thought it\nhad lost the purity of line of the earlier Seven in favour of\na beach buggy pastiche, while its extra equipment and comfort were derided as\nunnecessary and contrary to Chapman’s ‘less is more’ spirit. At £895 for the GT version\nand £995 for the Twin-Cam (both in kit form), they were not as cheap as the outgoing\nSeries 3 either.\nFrom March 1970, Series 4 Seven Type 60s were actually built by Lotus Racing\n(as Lotus Components was now called) rather than the main Hethel works. In line with\nWarner’s desire to sell more cars, and after an initial awkward period being sold through\nnormal Lotus dealers, they were marketed through a special dealer network. Up to 15\ncars were built each week, promoted with glamorous advertising. This was far in excess of\nthe level of any previous Seven model, scuppering the theory that the S4 was a sales flop.\nHowever it is true that sales never remotely reached the 2000-per-year mark at which\nWarner had been aiming. Export markets did not respond with the expected enthusiasm\nand the USA market was never exploited due to Federal emissions and safety laws.\nMike Warner left Lotus Racing in April 1971 to be replaced by John Standen, whose\ntask it was to wind down Lotus Racing. As a result, production of the Seven transferred\nacross to the main Lotus Cars facility in late 1971 where it sat uncomfortably with the\nElan. Chapman’s plans to push Lotus up-market were already in place and the Seven was\nrather too stark a reminder of the firm’s origins. Chapman had already decided to axe\nthe model but it stayed on in production until the large stock of chassis and parts had\nbeen run down. The very last Lotus Seven Series 4, Type 60 left the factory in October\n1972, after just 625 had been built.\nSeven Series 4\nType 60\n"

        "content": "Almost immediately it proved to be a popular design,\nparticularly with the successful Jim Russell Racing Drivers\nSchool team based at Snetterton, and quickly became an\nimportant model for the company and one destined to\nbe built in substantial numbers for a race car.\nThe Type 61 used a new multi-tubular space frame\nchassis fabricated using round-section tubing and\nstrengthened (as had been the Formula 2/3 Type 59s)\nwith a stressed steel under-tray. Suspension was again\ntypically Lotus in make-up with double wishbones pivoted\non nylon bearings and coil-spring/damper units at the\nfront. To the rear it used reversed lower wishbones, upper\nlinks, twin radius rods and coil-spring/damper units.\nDesigned, like so many cars of the period in the lower\nformula sector of the race car market, to accept a variety\nof engines (depending on customer choice), Lotus\nComponents nevertheless offered its own approved\npackage. In an exclusive engine distribution deal signed\nwith Holbay Racing Engines this comprised of a Lotus-\nHolbay LH/105 engine – 105bhp from a 1,599cc Ford\nCortina 1600E unit bored to 0.15-inch oversize and\nhoned – with a Hewland Mk VI four-speed transmission\nfitted as standard. This close-ratio ‘box was driven via\na single Borg and Beck racing type dry-plate diaphragm\nclutch; alternative ratios were of course available, and\nfairly easy to fit. A press release from Holbay stated that\n“The association with Lotus has been\nformed to allow the customer to\nbenefit from both the technical\nresources of Holbay and\nthe marketing facilities of Lotus to establish a reliable\nsource of competitive engines for 1969.”\nClearly influenced by its contemporary Indianapolis\nType 56 cousin, its wedge-shaped bodywork was of\nresin-bonded glass-fibre panels.

Oil cooling was via\na second radiator, situated in the tail panel above the\ngearbox and the aluminium alloy fuel tank, as usual,\nwas located behind the driver’s seat.\nIn this guise the cars’ success rates matched their\npopularity, particularly in the hands of Jim Russell’s\nracing school team. Indeed, while never quite able to\ntopple that year’s supremacy of the rival Alexis and\nMerlyn cars, one of Russell’s drivers, the Australian\nDave Walker – later to dominate an entire Formula\nThree season before winning a drive alongside\nEmerson Fittipaldi in the Formula One Type 72 –\nscored an impressive nine victories in the car to\ntake the Les Leston Formula Ford Championship.\nIn slightly modified ‘Type 61M’ form, the\nproduction version for the 1970 and 1971 seasons\ngained a new front end with a reduced frontal area.\nThis was introduced in a vain attempt to gain a little\nof the extra straight line speed needed to keep up with\nthe competition, the seemingly faster Merlyn and\nAlexis chassis.\n1969\nIntended to replace the 1967 Lotus 20-based\nType 51 – although cars of this type actually\nremained in production (and very much in\ncontention) for much of 1969 – the new Type\n61 Lotus Formula Ford single-seater was first\nshown by Lotus Components at that year’s\nRacing Car Show at Olympia in London.\nFormula Ford\nType 61\nMODEL\nType 61\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula Ford\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1969-71\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n248\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus Holbay LH105 Ford 1600E pushrod\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1598cc/105bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150in/59in/39in\nWHEELBASE\n90in\nWEIGHT\n820lb/372kg"

Thus the\nconstruction of a 4WD car was undertaken, and\ndrew heavily on the experiences learned through\nthe Type 56B project, which had used an all\nwheel-drive system. The result was the Type 63,\na vehicle which once again took Grand Prix\ncar design to the very limits, and one whose\nunconventional layout pointed up the shape\nof things to come.\nOnce more the power unit was the\nphenomenally successful Cosworth-designed\nand developed Ford DFV unit, but in every other\nrespect it was an entirely new machine. The\nengine was still mounted behind the driver, but\nMODEL\nType 63\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1969\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cosworth DFV\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2993cc/430bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n152in/74in/34in\nWHEELBASE\n98in\nWEIGHT\n1170lb/531kg\nwas now installed in the chassis the reverse way\nround to normal, driving forward to the gearbox\nwhich was mounted in the centre of the car.\nTransfer gears then carried the drive to the left-\nhand side of the car where the main driveshafts\nto the front and rear axle units lay within the\nmonocoque alongside the driver and engine.\nA complex arrangement, but an effective one,\nthis layout ensured the most efficient disposition\nof the major masses in the car, allowing the\nfullest use to be made of the four-wheel-drive\nconfiguration. That said, it was strongly criticised\nby Graham Hill and Jochen Rindt, both of whom\ndisliked the way it required the driver to position\nhis feet beneath the front axle tube in order to\nreach the pedals.\nAs with previous Lotus Formula 1 cars,\nthe chassis was of the monocoque type being\nfabricated of 18swg aluminium alloy-sheet\narranged to provide a strong yet light structure.\nThe cavities within this structure provided\nconvenient boundaries and support for five\nrubberised fuel cells (made by FTP of\nPortsmouth) with a combined capacity of 40\nImperial gallons. In order to improve and\nsimplify both construction and accessibility, all\nthe suspension and steering mounting points\nwere incorporated into two steel-tube subframes\nFormula 1\nType 63\nwhich formed the front and rear extremities of the car’s structure. The\ntransmission, centrally placed, was of Lotus design and concept but used\nthe expertise of both Hewland Engineering (for the change gears) and ZF\nof Germany for the transfer drive and torque-split differential.\nThe main driveshafts to the axles were constructed of solid steel,\nhoused inside hollow lightweight steel tubes containing intermediate\nsteady bearings. Mounted at the outboard ends of the axles, but inboard of\nthe wheels, Girling ventilated discs and brake caliper assemblies provided\nthe very considerable stopping power.\nThe reluctance of both Hill and Rindt to drive the Type 63 after trying\nthem out prior to the Dutch round persuaded Colin to draft John Miles into\nthe team and he drove the car for its debut at Clermont-Ferrand, retiring on\nlap two. Thereafter, more determined than ever that his two senior drivers\nshould campaign the new car in the next race, the British Grand Prix, Colin\nplanned to sell the existing Type 49s to Jo Bonnier and John Love. Objections\nwere swift in coming, however, prompting Chapman to withdraw the cars\nfrom sale; instead Miles returned to the 63’s driving seat, accompanied\nsomewhat ironically by Bonnier who was of course without a Type 49. Miles\nfinished only tenth and Bonnier retired early on. Hill who practiced in the\nType 63 (below) drove a Type 49 in the race.\nA firm fan of 4WD, Andretti agreed to drive the car in Germany and\nqualified in twelfth place. In the race itself, however, he crashed out on only\nthe second lap, the heavy car grounding badly and leaving the track. Miles\ndrove in the remaining races, but without much success.\nAfter a row with Colin, Rindt returned to the Type 63 for the Oulton\nPark Gold Cup, in the event finishing in second place – the best result for a\nmachine which, even Colin eventually admitted, was too weighty to succeed.\n"

Despite frequently running against much larger\nengined competition, they went on to set no fewer than\nten new circuit records.\nPowered by an impressive, all-new Lotus designed\nand built 2.0-litre engine, the car nevertheless retained its\nstrong family look: still as highly individual as the Type 47,\nbut with a distinctive new body style clothing an entirely\nnew chassis specification.\nDesigned by Martin Waide at Lotus Components, the\nexternal features which served most to differentiate the\nnew car from the Type 47 were its much more bulbous\nrear bodywork and the huge flared arches (both front\n& rear) to accommodate wheels and tyres of almost\nFormula 1 dimensions – 12-inch rims at the front, and\n15-inch wide at the rear. The glass-fibre body now\ncomprised three main parts with a fixed centre cockpit\nsection and two giant hinged front and rear sections.\nThis most purposeful-looking machine was further\ndistinguished by a large rear spoiler and smaller wings\nmounted on either side of the nose, the latter top-ducted\nto draw hot air away from the car’s cooling system.\nBut whilst the car looked much like the Type 47 it\nwas, as previously observed, quite different under the skin\nwith the traditional fabricated Lotus backbone chassis\nabandoned in favour of a complex multi-tubular\nspaceframe and Formula One-style rear suspension. The\nchassis carried the new twin-cam Lotus LV220/240\nengine, slanted at an angle of 45 degrees to the vertical.\nShortcomings which became evident as the season\nprogressed – and which in reality this prototype car had\nbeen conceived to identify and eliminate – led to the\ndevelopment of an entirely new engine design. In time\nthis new power unit became the Type 907 engine, the\nplant which was in various forms to power the Elite, Éclat\nand Esprit range of road cars for the next 25 years.\nWith a Tecalemit-Jackson fuel-injection system and\ndriving through a German ZF 5DS2 combined five-speed\ngearbox and final drive assembly, power output at\n8,000rpm was quoted as 220bhp.\nThe car debuted at Brands Hatch for the 1969 BOAC\n500, wearing the now well established red, white and gold\nlivery of Gold Leaf Team Lotus. However, with John\nMiles and Brian Muir sharing the controls, minor\nproblems kept the duo to thirteenth place overall, slightly\ndisappointing even if it represented a class win for the\n2.0-litre Prototypes. Thereafter, another car chassis was\nfabricated and the two cars were raced in a number of\nboth national and minor international fixtures, with Roy\nPike replacing Miles when the latter was driving his\nfour wheel-drive Type 63 Formula One car.\nAs such, the Type 62 notched up several wins –\nalthough often against fairly small fields – the car’s most\nimpressive appearances being a third place in the Tourist\nTrophy at Oulton Park and fourth overall in the Trophy\nof the Dunes (at Zandvoort) for Miles; Muir coming\nsixth in the latter event.\nBy revealing weaknesses in the Vauxhall block, and\nso hastening the development of what was to become the\nmainstay of Lotus engine production for almost quarter\nof a century, the Type 62 had in just a few races more\nthan made its mark on the company’s long history. Even\nso, none was raced by the factory team after that first\n1969 season, although one was later sold on to the jazz\nmusician Chris Barber and campaigned on his behalf\nby Dave Brodie.\nEven though there were only two chassis built and\ndespite their relative lack of success, thankfully both\nsurvived.

Four-wheel-drive cars, however, were limited to maximum rim widths of\nten inches at both front and rear – conventionally driven cars were allowed to run to\nfourteen. The resulting Type 64, known also as the STP-Oil Treatment Special, was\nshown to the press in late March 1969 before being flown out to the US for testing with\nMario Andretti. Along with the regular Team Lotus Formula 1 drivers, Hill and Rindt\nthe press were told, Andretti would drive the new car at that year’s Brickyard event.\nIts new monocoque was fabricated of 16swg aluminium sheet with the all-wheel\ntransmission system, Hewland gearbox and suspension set-up very similar to that of\nthe Type 63 Formula 1 car.\nFord provided the motive power with a Garrett turbocharged quad-cam V8 unit, with\na projected output of 750bhp. This proved to be a profound underestimate, and when\nthe engines were delivered to Hethel, it was discovered that some 1025bhp had regularly\nbeen seen on the dynamometer. There was a three second lag on the turbo though, and\nit was said that 500 horsepower came within a 500rpm powerband! On the Hethel test\ntrack, chief mechanic Arthur Birchall found it almost impossible to control the power.\nHe reported a terrible vibration which was discovered to be caused by all four wheels\nspinning every time the power was applied. After the first tests conducted in the USA,\na large ducktail spoiler was added to keep the rear down at speeds likely to be in\nexcess of 200mph.\nThree race cars and one spare were built, one being assigned to Andretti the other\ntwo to Hill and Rindt. Both Hill and Rindt disliked both the Formula 1 and Indy four-\nwheel-drive cars, and Rindt in particular didn’t enjoy Indy at all.\nMario Andretti ran the first test laps at Indy (above), and at a near record speed of\n171.656mph observed, “I haven’t turned my critter loose yet.” The other two cars for\nHill and Rindt arrived later and both drivers ran laps of 161mph. Rindt’s time was done\nwith a sticking throttle and a rough engine, before he eventually spun off at nearly 190mph.\nOn the 21st of May Andretti was looking like he was\nabout to set a pole winning time when he had a massive\naccident in turn 4 and his car was totally destroyed. While\nthere was a spare car available for him to use, it was\ndiscovered that the accident had been caused by failure\nof the right hand rear hub casting, brought on by the\nadditional loads imposed at high speed by the new\nrear spoiler.\nWithout the necessary time to design and fabricate\nnew finned hubs to prevent this overheating and\nMODEL\nType 64\nNAME/FORMULA\nIndycar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1969\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Turbo quad cam V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2650cc/1000+ bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n168in/75in/36in\nWHEELBASE\n100in\nWEIGHT\napprox. 1400lb/635kg\nIndycar\nType 64\nsubsequent failure, the cars were summarily withdrawn\nfrom the race and, having escaped the incident with only\nminor facial burns, Andretti reverted to his own Hawk-\nFord, qualifying well and eventually going on to win the\n1969 race.

It was duly allotted Type number 65.\nThe single most important difference between the\nAmerican and European cars was the fitment of a larger\n1565cc Renault engine taken from the 16TS, an\nup-market version of the Renault R16 launched in 1968.\nBecause the 1470cc engine was modified especially\nfor Lotus, it did not qualify under Federal emissions\nregulations. However, the larger engine did because it was\nleft exactly as it came from Renault. Federal equipment –\nincluding a catch tank and charcoal canister – overcame\nany problems with emissions. The larger engine still\nproduced 80bhp at 6000rpm, and so performance\nwas very similar.\nIn Federal form, the Europa S2 had a revised\nbodyshell to suit a variety of minor modifications, the\nmost obvious being the raised front wing and headlamp\nprofile, to comply with US regulations. New doors\nincorporated fresh internal and external locks and\nhandles, the wiring loom was modified to suit the fitment\nof brake fail lights and hazard warning lights, and the\ndemisters were modified.\nThe Federal-spec Europa was first produced in March\n1969 as a 1970 model year car, and put on the market at\na price of $4295, some $500 less than the Elan S4 had\nbeen. Shortly after introduction, further small changes\nwere made, such as revised headlamp pods, a new\nwindscreen wiper motor complete with new arms and\nblades, heater mounting bracket, and finally – alongside\nthe change to a bonded windscreen, new indicators,\nhazard flasher units and fan motor relay.\nThe Federal S2 was only withdrawn in December\n1971, some months after the last European Series 2 car\nhad been built, and by that stage, a total of 865 Series 2\nEuropas had been made to US Federal specifications."

However, in tests it appeared that\ncooling was insufficient in high ambient temperatures and the clean nose line soon had to\nbe modified to receive a radiator canted over and mounted within a top-ducted nose cone.\nThe Type 70 used the same track/wheelbase ratio as the company’s 1967 Formula 1\ncar, Type 49B. It also mimicked this car’s innovative construction, using the engine as\na stressed chassis element with the water radiator, engine and transmission oil coolers\nlocated aft.\nIn June 1969 Lotus decided to enter Formula\n5000, or Formula A as it was known in the USA.\nWith the new car scheduled to make its debut at\nSeptember’s Riverside race in California, this gave\nthe design team just ten weeks to design and build\na completely new car, the Type 70. In reality it took\nseveral months longer, and history records the car’s\nfirst appearance would actually be at Sebring on\nDecember 28th 1969, with Mario Andretti at\nthe wheel.\nDesigned by Martin Waide, the Type 70 actually used\na far simpler chassis than the Type 49. Colin Chapman\nhad insisted that the car be readily maintained by ‘the\naverage racing mechanic’ and as a result it comprised twin\nside boxes of 16 and 18-gauge aluminium sheet with an\n18-gauge aluminium undertray. Mild steel bracing (which\ndoubled-up as mounts for various smaller components)\nand complex folds on the inner surfaces of the side bays\nprovided much of the stiffness. In place of conventional\nbulkheads, the monocoque terminated with a flat panel\nbehind the seat and a mild steel box up front.\nPower came from a Shelby-modified Ford Boss 302 V8,\nwhich formed the rear part of the car by virtue of being\nbolted directly onto the monocoque, with the rear\nsuspension load carried via the bell housing and beefy\nHewland LG600 gearbox. From the start it was intended\nthat the car be suited equally to Ford or Chevrolet engines,\nwith slightly longer rear radius rods being supplied to\naccommodate the latter engine’s additional overall length.\nMario Andretti’s aforementioned Type 70 Sebring\ndebut started well enough but after 12 laps, by which time\nhe had a lead of almost 18 seconds, the engine blew up\nleaving Andretti to quit the Type 70 story – despite hopes\nat Lotus that he would campaign the car in the new year’s\nWest Coast race series – to pursue his other racing\ncommitments.\nElsewhere in the States, although never in Europe,\nthe car met with some success. The most successful was\nanother Boss car, the Falconer & Dunn-prepared 302\nof George Follmer, who went on to win at St. Jovite in\nCanada and at Mid-Ohio. He also finish a strong second\nat Lime Rock and third at Elkhart Lake.\nFormula A/5000\nType 70\nTheseventies\n“The 1970s brought more than just success on the\nracetrack.

That year,\nwith the maximum engine capacity raised to 2,000cc, Fittipaldi used a 1,930cc\nversion of Cosworth’s pricey but extremely potent BDA engine to win four races.\nOne last footnote to the Type 69’s history was provided by American Pete Lovely\nwho grafted the rear end from his Formula 1 Type 49 onto the back of 69-F2-5,\ncompeting with the resulting hybrid machine at both the 1971 Canadian and US\nGPs where he was the slowest qualifier in both events. Surely though, the Type 69\nis the only chassis type ever to compete in Formulae 1, 2, 3, and Formula B as well\nas Formula Ford.

By the second\nhalf of the year however, things were looking up,\nFittipaldi, now fully recovered from a serious road\ncar accident, achieved a few good results, the best\nbeing a strong second placed in the Austrian GP\nheld at the Österreichring, as well as another\nsecond at the final race of the season, the\nRothmans Victory Race at Brands Hatch.\nBy the end of the season, Team Lotus felt they\nwere making progress with the car, although with\nno race wins to its credit during the 1971 season –\nthe first time this had happened since 1960 –\nsomething needed to change.

Although some experts beleive that all\nSprints came with those aforementioned black wheels,\nLotus sales brochures from 1971 show the early Sprints\nwere specified with silver wheels. In 1972 even gold wheels\nwere aparently an option, or even ‘standard’ depending\non who you beleive! Federal cars had what were called\n‘earless’ knock-on spinners, although these were more\nrealistically just a large 8-sided ‘nut’ and difficult to use!\nThe most distinctive Sprint paint scheme was the carnival\nred, gold and white (with the bumpers being gold) that\ncelebrated the success of the Lotus’ Formula 1 team in\nthe late sixties and early seventies by mimicking the then\ncontroversial Gold Leaf Team Lotus (tobacco brand)\nlivery.

The big valve cars’ price had\njumped from £2375 when it was launched in early 1969\nto £2676, but the 25 percent power boost did increase\nperformance to a top speed of just under 125mph, and a\ngenuine 0-60mph capability of less than 7.5 seconds.\nLotus brochures in 1971 were again quick to use Lotus\nracing heritage to promote the new model; “Taking its\nplace alongside vehicles costing twice the price, sharing\ntheir social acceptance, whilst rivalling their performance\nand durability, the +2S130 has all the design experience\nand engineering integrity that you would expect from a\nmanufacturer with World Championship traditions to\nmaintain” was how the +2S130 was promoted.\nAnother hoped-for optional extra, a five-speed\ngearbox, was introduced in October 1972, cars so fitted\nbeing named +2S130/5. The overdrive five-speed\ngearbox was a great improvement, since it allowed\ncruising in top gear at some 1400rpm less than before,\nwhile the lower ratios remained virtually unaltered and\nacceleration in the lower gears was unaffected.

The use of this gearbox also influenced\nthe choice of engine, the 105bhp Lotus Twin-cam. Had\nthe factory opted for the more powerful version, as indeed\nit was to do later, a rather stronger and so more costly\ntransmission assembly would have been called for.\nDespite the car’s broadly similar external appearance,\nthis was, all in all, an extensive revision to the existing\nmodel. The company clearly paid heed to the comments\nand constructive criticisms of the many Lotus owners and\nindependent road testers with first-hand experience of the\nearlier Type 46 and who had enjoyed its racing car layout\nand spirited handling.\nThe most obvious modification was to the Europa’s\ncharacteristic rear fins which were cut down almost to the\nlevel of the rear deck.

A new chin spoiler\nrefreshed the appearance of the front end and two new\nfuel tanks increased the car’s fuel capacity to 12.5 gallons.\nA revised gearchange linkage and improved suspension\ncompleted the package which was attractively priced at\n£1,995 (including car tax) or just £1,595 if supplied\nin component form.\nFinally, the company’s own 5½-inch ‘Brand Lotus’\nlight alloy wheels served to further distinguish the new\ncar from the Types 46 and 54. Although most Twin-cam\nengined Europas seemed to have these wheels fitted, they\nwere actually only ever supplied for the Europa Twin-cam\nas an optional extra, and at a cost of £101. Standard\nfitment for the car was still the 4½x13-inch steel wheels\nas used on the earlier Series 2 Type 54.\nWith the fitting of either Dellorto or Weber\ncarburettors, performance from the well-proven LF/105\nTwin-cam unit was impressive: 120mph maximum,\n0-60mph taking around 8.2 seconds, and good fuel\neconomy too, with one independent assessor reportedly\nsqueezing an incredible 74.4mpg at a steady 30mph.\nAt a more realistic 70mph, the 1,588lb Europa Twin-Cam\nstill managed to return an acceptable 35mpg and under\nreal-life driving conditions, an overall figure of 30mpg\nseemed perfectly possible.\nFor the American market only, the Europa Twin-Cam\nused the big valve engine that was being used in the Elan\nSprint, and which would later be fitted to the Europa\nSpecial. This was done in a vain attempt to keep the\npower output of the heavily restricted Federal\nspecification car somewhere near that of its European\nspecification Twin-cam powered cousin. The big-valve\nengine in European trim was putting out close to 130bhp,\nbut by the time it had made the trip across the Atlantic\nthis had fallen to just 105bhp. This was due mainly to the\nfact that the high-compression aspect of the engine was\ndropped for US bound cars, changes in camshaft timing\nas well as the use of Weber carburettors in place of either\nthe sidedraught 40DLHA Dellortos on the first cars built,\nor Strombergs on later models.\nThe new Europa Twin-Cam formed a big part of the\nfinancial recovery of Group Lotus during 1971. With the\nclosure of Lotus Components coming before the year\nwas half way through, the emphasis of Lotus was now\nfocussed on the road car production side of business. The\nfuture for the company was looking bright. Gross profit\nfor the first half of 1971 was a healthy £324,000, a figure\nalready £2000 above that reached for the whole of the\nprevious year, and with turnover in this period topping\n£2,250,000 and export sales of over the £1 million mark,\nGroup Lotus was clearly well on the way up the league of\nBritish car manufacturers. With the profits from the new\nType 74 Europa not starting to come through until the\nsecond half of the year, things could only improve.\nMODEL\nType 74\nNAME/FORMULA\nEuropa Twin-Cam\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1971-72\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1580\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus Ford Twin-cam\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1558cc/105bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n157.5in/64.5in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n92in\nWEIGHT\n1588lb/720kg\n1971\nEuropa Twin-Cam\nType 74\nSince the mid-1960s Lotus had been building\nthe successful Renault-engined version of its\nlow-slung Type 46 sports car.

The car’s next\nouting was at Oulton Park for the Rothmans Trophy in\nApril, by which time slightly smaller diameter Firestone\ntyres were fitted along with revised bumpstops and brake\ncooling ducts. Reine Wisell drove and was running fifth\nuntil a tyre burst, once again damaging the suspension\nand forcing him out of the race.\nFittipaldi returned to the driver’s seat for the car’s third\nrace – the International Trophy at Silverstone – but yet\nagain suspension problems forced him out of the first heat\nalthough he inherited a third place in the second heat,\nfinishing 13th overall.\nWith somewhat bulbous bodywork modifications to\naccommodate larger fuel tanks on either side, the car next\nappeared at the Jochen Rindt Memorial race held at\nHockenheim, with Australian Dave Walker down to drive.\nThe car though, failed to make it to the start of the race\nafter an engine failure in practice. He took the car out\nagain for a very wet Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort,\nbut despite the distinct advantages of four-wheel-drive\non a greasy track, slid off the into the fencing at Tarzan\nCorner. After starting on the back row – and after just five\nlaps – at the time of his mishap he was already running in\n10th place. Colin Chapman was furious, feeling that\nWell in advance of its time when launched in 1968,\na new lease of life for the Type 56 Indycar concept was\nannounced by the factory in the August of 1970. Design\nwork had actually started in August 1968 to produce a\nrevised version of the car, to be known as the Lotus Type\n56B but due to changes in policy for the Lotus Formula 1\nprogramme in 1969, only one Type 56B chassis was\ncompleted.\nDue to contractual commitments and the required\nmodification of the Pratt & Whitney unit to meet\nFormula One equivalent specification, Indycar chassis\n56/2 was initially built up into Formula 1 specification\nas chassis 56B/1, but without a power unit. A statement\nfrom Gold Leaf Team Lotus stated, “it has become\npossible to reconsider the earlier proposal and with\nthe co-operation of United Aircraft of Canada Limited,\na programme to modify the gas turbine engine and\nto install it in a chassis has become a reality.”\nWhile the chassis remained basically the same as that\nof the original Type 56, the opportunity was taken to\nimprove general accessibility and to simplify specific\nstructural details. It was thus of the monocoque type\nfabricated in aluminium alloy with two main side\nsponsons containing rupture-proof fuel cells. Four-wheel-\ndrive enabled the car to run identical suspension fore\nand aft: spring and damper assemblies mounted well\ninboard and operated by rocking arm extensions of\nthe top wishbones.\nThe Formula One Pratt & Whitney engine was also\nvery similar to its Indy predecessor, using an STN76\nturbine with a single axial compressor stage and a\ncentrifugal stage feeding an annular combustion chamber.\nThe output stage powered an epicyclic reduction gear\nand the drive shafts. As with the Indy car, the driver had\njust two pedals: a throttle and what one commentator\njokingly called “the biggest brake pedal ever seen in\nFormula 1” – an oblique reference to concerns about the\ncar’s braking ability given the absence of conventional\nengine over-run assistance.\nWaker had lost out on a great opportunity not only to win a Grand Prix at his first\nattempt but to make history with a first ever win for a Turbine car.\nWisell drove the car in the British round, but lost power and remained unclassified,\nwhile Fittipaldi returned for the Italian Grand Prix where, as a result of legal problems\nassociated with Rindt’s fatal accident the previous year, he drove the only Lotus entry\nunder the Worldwide Racing banner, running in gold and black colours (above). He\nfinished in eighth place and the Type 56B story would have ended there but for one more\nappearance – at Hockenheim again – for the Preis de Nationen Formula 5000 race.\nHere the Brazilian set the fastest lap and finished in second place.

Other new sponsors coming into the fold\nwere Texaco, who took over from Shell as fuel and oils supplier, while Champion\nspark plugs replaced the in-house Ford brand of plugs, Autolite. The team did\nhowever stay with the same tyre manufacturer, Firestone, for this year at least.\nThe car shown at the Hethel launch, on a typical cold, grey December day in\nNorfolk, was essentially the same as the car run throughout 1971, but by the time of\nthe secondary sponsors announcement the car sported a dramatic new ‘anvil’ shaped\nairbox and deep end plates on the rear wing.\nDuring 1971, talented Swede Reine Wisell had been\ncompletely overshadowed by the brilliant Fittipaldi, and\nfound himself dropped, replaced by Australian Dave\nWalker (seen left at the Nürburgring). Walker had\nimpressed Colin Chapman driving both the Type 59\nand in particular the Type 69 Formula three cars,\nand was brought into the team amid high hopes for\nthe future.\nWalker, however, was to fare little better than his\npredecessor, and had to watch as Fittipaldi quickly\nasserted his place in the team, as he started to challenge\nfor the 1972 World Championship. The first race of\nthe season in Argentina brought little in the way of joy,\nbut by the second race in South Africa, Fittipaldi was\nchallenging for the race lead and would eventually\nfinish second.\nOverall victory in two non-championship races was\nfollowed by wins in Spain, Belgium, Britain, Austria and\nItaly. As well as these, his Type 72D also crossed the line\nsecond at Clermont-Ferrand and third at Monaco. The\nChampionship-clinching win for both the Drivers and\nthe Constructors Titles at Monza was a memorable day\nfor the whole team, so different to same day two years\nearlier when it had been one of the darkest for Colin\nChapman and Team Lotus. Although he scored no\nfurther points during the remaining two races of the\nseason, Fittipaldi remained on a high, knowing he had\nbecome the youngest driver ever to take the title.\nFor 1973, Fittipaldi was joined by ‘Superswede’\nRonnie Peterson, and with the team switching to\nGoodyear tyres, they started the season in terrific form.\nFittipaldi won both the Brazilian and Argentine rounds\nin a 72D, before the cars were revised yet again with\nnew double-skinned lateral crash-pads, and new\nundertrays. Further chassis modifications were made to\ncomply with new deformable fuel-tank regulations and\nthe car was re-named the Type 72E before Fittipaldi\nwent on to win again, this time at Monjuich Park in\nSpain (above). The 72E would be further developed\nfor the 1974 season.\nPeterson meanwhile was still searching for his first\nelusive Grand Prix victory. After leading the way in\nseveral races during the early season, he finally took the\nchequered flag in first place at the French Grand Prix,\nheld at Paul Ricard. From this point on, he outscored all\nthe other drivers in the championship and finished the\nseason in third place overall, just three points behind\nFittipaldi, having come home second at Silverstone\nand winning in Austria, Italy and in the USA."

The basic design was originally done by\nMaurice Philippe, but after his departure to assist the\nVels Parnelli team with their new Formula 1 car,\ncompletion was left to Martin Waide and David Baldwin.\nThey incorporated many of the more successful features\nof the Type 72, including a full monocoque centre section,\nside-mounted radiators, a complex sub-frame mounting for\nthe front suspension and the unitary engine/transmission/\nsuspension assembly at the rear end.\nThe aforementioned forward tubular sub-frame\ncarried the rack and pinion steering and inboard brakes as\nwell as rising rate front suspension with fabricated double\nwishbones and inboard spring and damper units. The air\nrestricted 130bhp Novamotor-developed Lotus dohc\nengine and a Hewland Mark 8 gearbox formed a stressed\nchassis member, attached using a tubular framework and,\nwith inboard rear brakes, the rear suspension was formed\naround single upper links, parallel twin lower links, twin\nradius arms with outboard coil-spring/damper assemblies.\nAt its launch, Peter Warr of Lotus agreed that it was a\ncomplicated design, admitting at the time that “there is as\nmuch work in the suspension of this F3 as there was in the\nwhole of the Type 69 chassis”, but with John Player’s\nfinancial backing, hopes were high for the new car\nparticularly when enthusiasts and factory alike considered\nthe success of the similar Type 72 and the new car’s highly\ndistinctive appearance. With this relatively sophisticated\nspecification, its flat-top wedge nose, the curved side panels\nof the monocoque bulging out beneath the driver and the\nvisual appeal of the superb JPS livery\n, the Type 73 looked\nevery inch the professional job that it certainly was.\nTwo cars were built, one each for Tony Trimmer –\nwho had done much of the early testing – and Bernard\nVermilio, as well as one spare monocoque tub. Trimmer\ntook the car out for its debut run, coming only sixth at\nMallory Park inMarch 1972, at which point it became\nclear that some further development work was needed if\n1972\nMODEL\nType 73\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 3\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1972\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2\nENGINE TYPE\nNovamotor Ford dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1598cc/130bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n148in/71in/36in\nWHEELBASE\n95in\nWEIGHT\n884lb/401kg\nFormula 3\nType 73\nConceived to complement the stunning success\nof its big brother, the innovative and triumphant\nType 72, the Lotus Type 73 was a Formula 3 car\nintended to sport the same black and gold JPS\nlivery and, it was hoped, follow its winning form.\nIts origins derived from a proposed Formula 2\ncar planned for the 1971 season but which fell\nvictim to the closure of Lotus Racing (Lotus\nComponents) who built the customer race cars.\nthis attractive but perhaps overly-complex design was to\nfulfil its potential.\nShortly afterwards, however, Trimmer took a good\nsecond at the prestigious Formula 3 support race to the\nMonaco Grand Prix (despite suffering tyre overheating\nproblems), beaten only by the highly competitive Alpine-\nRenault of Patrick Depailler, and that with its suspect\nRenault engine. In April he took first place at Mallory\nPark, having placed fourth the previous month at Brands\nHatch. Other notable drives for Trimmer in the Type 73\nincluded a fifth placing atMallory, and a sixth at Swedish\ncircuit Anderstorp in the early summer.\nVermilio, whose car was fitted with a slightly smaller\ncockpit than Trimmer’s, fared less well, finishing just\nfourth at Zandvoort and sixth at Paul Ricard. Eventually,\nand perhaps inevitably given the results obtained, factory\ninterest in Formula 3 and its Type 73 dwindled to the\npoint where Lotus withdrew. As a result, no longer\nengaged in the design and commercial manufacture of\nracing cars to suit this particular formula, Lotus and JPS\nwere completely out of the Formula 3 scene by the close\nof the year, never to return.\nEventually one of the team cars found employment\nas a useful test bed for the Novamotor/Ford Formula 2\nengine, and a Type 73B version of the car was developed\ntowards the end of the year, but once Lotus and its\nsponsor John Player had decided to concentrate on\nFormula 1, this too was set aside.\nThe following year, Dr Joseph Ehrlich acquired both\ncars, (and a spare chassis) one of them appearing later\nthat year as an Ehrlich-Lotus and driven by Patrick Neve,\nbut with little success.\nIn the final analysis then, this was a mini Formula 1\ncar which never really fulfilled its much anticipated early\npromise. Technically extremely advanced, perhaps too\nadvanced for its chosen formula, it differed too radically\nfrom its rivals. Without the benefit of a major works\ndevelopment program, the car struggled to stay on the\npace for much of the season."

The disc brakes were inboard at all four corners,\nand the side-mounted radiators for oil and water were\nfitted almost flush to the sides of the monocoque.\nPower came from the Lotus Type 906 alloy block, a\ntwin overhead camshaft unit of 1,973cc and, some said,\na derivation of its production engine, itself based on the\ncast iron General Motors/Vauxhall Victor unit that had\nalready been extensively modified by Novamotor.

In an effort to\nsecure a competitive position, Ronnie Peterson repeatedly\nswitched from one car to the other. Inevitably, as a result,\nMorgan failed to qualify for the race and so all hopes\nrested on Peterson’s shoulders. However, after only eight\nlaps, he was out too after suffering another engine failure.\nBoth cars failed to make an appearance at both the\nRome Grand Prix and at Estoril, whereupon Lotus pulled\nthe two cars (the development car had been destroyed in\na fire at Snetterton) completely from Formula 2 in order\nto concentrate its efforts on Formula 1.\nUnveiled in to the public at Zolder in May of\n1973, some confusion attends this model and\nits shared identity with the road-going Europa\nTwin-Cam of 1971, also known as the Type 74.\nAs with the John Player Special cars of the time,\nit seems this particular Formula 2 contender was\nnever actually allocated an official mark number\nby the factory; instead the two racing cars built\nwere simply known as the “Texaco Stars.”\n118"

By this time the owner of two boat-building concerns,\nMoonraker and JCL Marine, Colin had been seeking a way of using technology to\nreduce the time spent in the labour-intensive process of hand-laying glass-fibre. His\nsolution, well-suited to both his marine and motoring requirements, was Vacuum-\nAssisted Resin Injection (VARI), in which pre-cut glass-fibre matting is laid into\nmoulds and the air expelled as the resin mix is injected under pressure.\nWhen it came to the Elite, this meant building the new car in two halves, top and\nbottom, hence its distinctive and practical lateral rubbing strip which also serves to hide\nthe join between the two halves. Using this efficient system for both his boats and cars,\nColin saw an opportunity to secure great savings in time and labour. The Elite showed\nit could be made to work and before long the same new and innovative technology\nwould be used to build the new Éclat and Esprit.\n"

In appearance it was a slightly angular,\n‘delta’ shaped car, further distinguished by the\nrakish aesthetics of its high air collector and an\nunusual bi-plane rear wing.\nThe suspension, however, remained broadly\nsimilar to that of the Type 72, using in-board discs\nat both front and back, and the same torsion bar\narrangement but with new fabricated wishbones\nat the front end and twin parallel upper links at\nthe back, with single lower links and twin radius\nrods.

Once underway, his\nthrottle jammed open, throwing him into his team mate\nand unfortunately removing both at the first corner.\nShortly afterwards at Silverstone Peterson’s Type 76\nled the field in the International Trophy but with a\nconventional three-pedal arrangement. However, after\nstruggling with tyre blistering problems, he was forced to\nretire with a seized engine. Thereafter the fourth pedal\nwas to disappear completely, the auto-clutch itself was\nshelved ‘for further development’ – but victory still\neluded the Type 76.\nIn Spain, Peterson again led the race but the cars\nwere still far from sorted and once more he retired with\nbrake difficulties and another engine failure. This failure\nwas brought on by overheating caused by starting the\nwet race with heavily taped radiators which, when the\nrain stopped and the track dried, caused the water\ntemperature to soar. In Belgium the team fared even\nless well, both cars retiring and prompting a return to\nthe Type 72 with the Type 76 ignominiously demoted\nto a mere source of spares.\nIn Peterson’s opinion the new car was simply too\nheavy – as heavy indeed as the Type 72 it was intended\nto supersede – and its handling quite unsatisfactory. He\npressured Chapman to abandon the car and start again\nwith a new design and, persuaded by his respected driver,\nChapman eventually concurred.\nEven so, the Type 76 lived to race another day.\nFollowing a particularly destructive accident during testing\nfor the German Grand Prix in his Type 72, a new mount\nhad to be built up overnight, and Peterson found himself\ndriving a hybrid car utilising the front suspension and\nentire monocoque of the Type 76 (with squared off sides),\nwith the rear end of a Type 72 grafted on. This he took\nto fourth place, Ickx going on to drive a similar machine\nalbeit without success, in both Italy and Austria.\nOnce again a Team Lotus racing car made its final\nappearance in the USA. Tim Schenken was nominated\nto drive the Type 76 in the United States Grand Prix at\nWatkins Glen alongside the revised Type 72s of Peterson\nand Ickx, although he was disqualified for starting the\nrace illegally from the pit lane.\nWith the Type 72 having been developed to an early\n72E configuration part way through 1973, the car was\nfurther modified for 1974, mainly to conform with new\nregulations on the placement of the rear wing and\nexternal oil tanks. Changes to the suspension to suit the\nnew Goodyear tyres were also made, and in fact included\nsome parts that had been fitted to the early 1973 cars.\nRonnie Peterson’s team mate Jacky Ickx (right) quickly\nestablished himself by winning in style at the soaking wet\nBrands Hatch Race of Champions. After this astonishing\nvictory, Ickx had little in the way of results in the Type\n72E though, just two third places and a total of only 12\npoints in 1974.\nAfter a brief interlude with the new Type 76, which\nhad been introduced at Kyalami, team leader Peterson\ndemanded that they should return to the Type 72 and, in\nhis customary style, took the car by the scuff of the neck\nstorming to victory in Monaco, France and Italy, a quite\nconsiderable achievement for a design which had, by\nthen, been racing for four seasons. A fitting swansong\none would have thought, for the Type 72.\nHowever, the car was to be campaigned for yet one\nmore season. Peterson and Ickx were persuaded to stay on\nat Lotus for 1975, although in the event, outright victory\nevaded any Lotus driver throughout the 1975 Formula 1\nseason. Jacky Ickx left after the French Grand Prix to be\nreplaced by a string of number two drivers including\nBrian Henton, Jim Crawford and John Watson.\nEven so, the results tables show the Type 72 to have\nbeen one of the most successful racing cars of all time.\nWith twenty World Championship Grand Prix wins, three\nFormula 1 Constructors’ cups and an effective working life\nof nearly half a decade, the cars which came to be known\nthe world over as ‘John Player Specials’ had more than\nmade their mark.\nMODEL\nType 72E\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1974-75\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nIncluded in total for Type 72\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cosworth DFV\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2933cc/480bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n165in/74in/48in\nWHEELBASE\n105in\nWEIGHT\n1200-1280lb/544-581kg\nFormula 1\nType 72E\n"

While the lower\nhalf of the bodyshell remained essentially the same, above\nthe ‘join’ the roofline plunged deeply into a fastback tail –\nthe car had originally been conceived and for a time was\nknown in Lotus circles as the Elite Coupé – even though it\nterminated with a conventional bootlid instead of the\nElite’s ‘hatchback’ arrangement. The green car seen here\nis the actual Elite Coupé prototype built and tested before\nthe first production models were produced. Surprisingly it\nsurvived with its 1974 registration and has now been\nrestored to near original specification, complete with\nmetallic green paintwork.\nOliver Winterbottom’s new coupé styling was clearly\nevery bit as satisfactory as the work he had done on the\nElite, but as a design it made much less of an impression\nat its launch as it simply carried on what the Elite had\nstarted. That is to say that while the Elite’s radical design\nhad signified to the public a major departure and renewal\nfor its maker, the Éclat simply confirmed this totally\nnew direction.\nMODEL\nType 76\nNAME/FORMULA\nÉclat\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1975-80\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1299 (all models)\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 907, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1973cc/160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n175.5in/71.5in/47in\nWHEELBASE\n98in\nWEIGHT\n2160lb/980kg\n1975\nÉclat\nType 76\nSimilar in many key respects to the Type 75\nElite, and confusingly carrying the same type\nnumber as the 1974 Formula 1 John Player\nSpecial Mark I, the Lotus 907-powered Éclat\nwas intended to sell at a lower price than that\nof the ‘hatch-back’ Elite.\nMechanically the two cars were broadly speaking very\nsimilar with the same backbone chassis, independent\nsuspension all round, with an anti-roll bar at the front, and\nthe same Europa-like arrangement to the rear. By the time\nthe cars went on sale, however, a higher final drive ratio\nwas fitted to the Éclat and, like the Elite, it was to be\nprogressively developed over the next five years until May\n1980 when it was replaced by the new Type 84 Éclat S2.\nOriginally designated the 520, the 160bhp car’s basic\nspecification – and it was always intended to be a lower\nspecified car than the costlier Elite – included smaller 13-\ninch steel wheels, and a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox\nfrom Ford. This, the only version available at the launch\nprice of £5,729, was not initially a huge success until it\nwas recognised that Éclat buyers preferred a much higher\nspecification even if this meant paying extra. Thus in\n1977 the factory wheeled out the modified Éclat Sprint.\nRather confusingly, the standard Éclat was initially sold\nin the USA simply as the ‘Sprint’, so things became even\nmore complicated when the Éclat Sprint was launched.\nOver time, mechanical and in-car specification and\nequipment levels on the Éclat continued to improve in\ntrue Lotus fashion. The 521 model, which was also\navailable in Sprint form at a 1977 price of £8,372,\ngained the Austin Maxi-derived 5-speed Lotus gearbox.\nThe 522 was still better equipped, comparable indeed\nto the Elite 502, while the 523 took on board air\nconditioning, a revised stereo cassette and radio, electric\nwindows with tinted glass all-round, and power-steering.\nAble to return nearly 21mpg, Autocar found this\nlatest version to be capable of 129mph with 0-60mph\ntaking 7.9 seconds. That is a credible performance for\na four-seater of the period, although that designation\nmight have been an exaggeration:, even the Éclat\nenthusiast must acknowledge that if the rear seats of\nthe Elite were a squeeze, with the lower roofline, those\non the Éclat were tighter still, and correspondingly\nless useful to their purpose.\n122"

        "content": "The John Player Special Mark II or Lotus Type 77 was\nannounced on the 18th September 1975, and unveiled\nat a time when the team was widely perceived as having\nslipped behind several of its more important rivals in\nterms of both technical development and outright\nperformance. As such it was something of an interim\nmeasure, built to ‘hold the fort’ during the 1976 season,\nwhile work continued apace on the forthcoming but\nstill top-secret Type 78.\nBased on a particularly slim aluminium\nmonocoque designed by Geoff Aldridge, the Type 77\nwas the work of a team assembled under Peter Warr\nand comprising Aldridge, Mike Cooke and Martin\nOgilvie. The challenge was to clear away memories\nof the underwhelming Type 76, and to devise a workable\nand competitive (if temporary) replacement for the\nincreasingly geriatric Type 72.\nAt this time the lengthy road circuits of the 1960s\nwere being replaced by shorter, tighter circuits, a move\nwhich called for an entirely new approach to racing\ncar design. Colin Chapman’s solution was adjustable\nsuspension, variable in both track and wheelbase as\nwell as in several other key respects. The aim, naturally\nenough, was to reconcile the fact that on short, fast\ncorners short-wheelbase cars stole the advantage whilst\non the faster curves it was the longer-wheelbase cars\nwhich took the lead.\nMartin Ogilvie’s solution to the problem of utilising\ninboard brakes but securing total adjustability was a\ntypically ingenious, if not Chapmanesque arrangement\nwhereby each brake’s twin calipers were designed to\ndouble as structural suspension supports. Aldridge,\nmeanwhile, clothed the ensemble with the by now usual\nfibre-glass bodywork shrouding a neat structural pyramid\nmounted above the driver’s legs and tidy engine air\nintakes on either side of the cockpit (top right).\nAt this time Ronnie Peterson was still with the team,\nbut Lotus had some difficulty finding him a team mate\nuntil Mario Andretti agreed to drive for them in the\nfirst round of the Championship in Brazil. In practice,\nPeterson left the track after coolant had leaked onto a rear\ntyre and in the race itself the two cars collided, prompting\nRonnie to leave for the March team, and Andretti to defer\nto his US commitments, leaving the field open for two\nrelatively inexperienced newcomers, Bob Evans and\nSwede Gunnar Nilsson.\nThe pair raced the 77s in South Africa, at Brands\nHatch and at Long Beach but without success until a\nsuspension modification rectified an enduring tyre\nwarming problem which was inherent in the new car’s\ndesign. The inboard brakes offered the front tyres no form\nof much needed heating as well as adding a lot of extra\nweight. As soon as more traditional outboard brakes and a\nrocker arm front suspension system were adopted (below),\nthe car performed much better. Thereafter, at Silverstone,\nNilsson campaigned a lone Type 77 managing to qualify\nin fourth place and eventually finishing in sixth.\nFor the European opener in Spain, and with the cars\nsporting a new design of airbox behind the drivers’s head\n(below), Andretti returned to the fold. In the race itself,\nhowever, he was forced to retire although Nilsson took\nan excellent third place. It was at this time, in a bid to\nimprove the cars’ overall reliability, that the highly\nexperienced Tony Southgate – formerly with BRM,\nEagle and Shadow – joined the team as chief engineer\nand trackside troubleshooter.\nBelgium saw both drivers retire and while Andretti\nwent off to compete at Indianapolis, Nilsson again failed\nto finish at Monaco. Things looked better at the\nAnderstorp circuit in Sweden, however, where Andretti\nqualified on the front row and actually led for 45 laps until\nhis engine exploded. By then Nilsson had already spun\nout into the pitwall, but Lotus was clearly climbing out of\ntrouble and at the Österreichring in August the two cars\ncame in third and fifth. Andretti scored another third\nplace at Mosport Park in Canada before taking pole\nposition in qualifying for the Japanese GP at Mt. Fuji.\nDriving extremely skillfully in the horrendous weather\nconditions which prevailed during the race, he held\nMODEL\nType 77\nNAME/FORMULA\nJPS Mk II, Formula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1976\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n3\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cosworth DFV\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2993cc/475bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173.5in/80in/36in\nWHEELBASE\n104.5in\nWEIGHT\n1270lb/576kg\n1976\nFormula 1\nType 77\nsecond place before dropping back to conserve his tyres.

        "content": "Based on a substantially modified Europa Twin-Cam chassis, the razor-\nedged show car, internally designated Project M70 (below), was destined to\nbecome the longest-running of all Lotus production cars, when eventually\nchristened the Esprit.\nUnquestionably one of the show’s real stars, the new car was nevertheless\npainfully slow to develop, that effort taking place over a two-year time span.\nThe first pre-production prototype did not appear until late 1974, but the\nannouncement of the production model itself was left until the following\nOctober. That made it almost three years since Giugiaro’s exciting design\nhad caught the public mood at Turin. The many well-publicised financial\ndifficulties at Lotus conspired to slow the progress yet again so that\nproduction of the Esprit did not start until well into 1976. However\nunwelcome the record-breaking four-year gestation period was to prove,\nthe mere fact that the car’s design was still widely applauded when it finally\nwent on sale says a lot for the enduring appeal of Giugiaro’s original and\nfuturistic 1972 design study.\nAt the Turin motor show in November 1972,\nGiorgetto Giugiaro’s Ital Design studio had\nshown a stunning silver mid-engined concept\ncar developed in close liaison with Lotus.\nIt appeared every bit as extraordinary as\nrival Bertone’s earlier, yet still truly radical,\nmid-engined (Lancia) Stratos show car.\nMechanically there was little to surprise the\nseasoned Lotus-watcher as yet another Lotus\nproduction car appeared using the familiar steel\nbackbone chassis, this time with the forked\nsection at the back and with the cross-member up\nat the front. In naming the car, Lotus continued\nwith its alliterative tradition of leading with the\nletter ‘E’ and, to many ears, acquitted themselves\nsuccessfully after the earlier choice of the\nsomewhat awkward moniker given the Éclat.\nThe Esprit, while still a close-coupled two\nseater, was intended from the start to be a larger,\nmore useable machine than the pretty but\noccasionally claustrophobic Europa. Accordingly,\nthe principal dimensions of the backbone chassis\nand cross-members were exaggerated in order\nto give the finished car a more spacious and\nroomy interior.\nDespite the number of modifications required\nto simplify production and reduce manufacturing\ncosts, the appearance of the body was remarkably\nsimilar to Ital Design’s original concept. For legal\nreasons the particularly shallow rake of the\nwindscreen on Giugiaro’s car was increased, but\nthe new Lotus stayed close to the exciting and\nrakish shape which had caused such a stir four\nyears earlier.\nThe 1,973cc type 907 engine, taken directly\nfrom the Elite and Éclat, developed an acceptable\n160bhp at 6,200rpm and was mounted ahead of\nthe rear axle line, canted at 45 degrees to the left.\nLess expected perhaps was the transmission, a\ncombined five-speed gearbox and final drive unit\n1976\nEsprit\nType 79\nMilestone Car\n“There is a most attractive body on the ITAL Design stand built\non a Lotus Europa, a real eye catcher. Colin Chapman told me\nthat he is considering going into production with it..”\nJohn Bolster\nlifted from the short-lived SM Citröen-Maserati\nmarriage. More humble were the origins of the\nfront suspension, which differed little from the\nset-up employed in several more mundane saloon\ncars of the day: double wishbones and coil-\nspring/damper assemblies with an anti-roll bar\nand solid disc brakes.\nThe independent rear suspension was of\ncourse more complex, comprising fixed-length\ndriveshafts which doubled as the upper\ntransverse links, lower transverse links, box-\nsection semi-trailing arms and coil-spring/\ndamper units with inboard discs. Steering was by\nrack and pinion, unassisted in the early cars. The\nwheels were distinctive 14-inch diameter, 5-slot\nWolf race alloys, with a black and silver Lotus\ncentre-cap, 6-inch wide at the front and 7-inch\nat the rear. With higher profile 205-70VR14 tyres\nspecified at the rear, rather than the 195-60VR14\nused at the front, the wheel/tyre combination\nreinforced the dramatic wedge appearance\nof the car.\nLaunched in the Autumn of 1975 with a price\nof £5,844, the production delays meant that by the\ntime the first customer cars were actually being\ndelivered in 1976, the price had risen to £7,883.\nBut while nobody could quibble about the car’s\nappearance, including striking tartan seats in\nsome of the early cars (above), its performance\nwas slightly down on expectations – Autocar quite\nclearly failed to achieve the claimed top speed\nand acceleration figures – but who cared, it\nlooked great and handled superbly!\n124"

        "content": "Clearly disturbed by the relatively poor performance of\nthe Type 76, in the summer of 1975 Chapman had shut\nhimself away to think of a solution and decided that what\nhe and his team needed was a ‘wing car’. In a detailed\n27-page document he set out his ideas and requirements\nbefore handing the project on to Tony Rudd, the hugely\ntalented Rolls-Royce trained engineer who had served\nwith such distinction at BRM.\nInspiration for the car came from many sources,\nnotable among them the inner wing section of the\ndeHavilland Mosquito, and Rudd set out to devise a car\nwhich used its entire form to shape its aerodynamics\ninstead of one which sought merely to compensate for\nan aerodynamically redundant shape by adding wings\nin the conventional manner. Maximum downforce\nwith minimum drag became the team’s new Holy Grail.\nThe resulting monocoque was as slim as that fitted\nto the Type 77, but with wide panniers either side, a\nstructural top panel above the driver’s legs and (for the\nfirst time at Lotus) its construction made extensive use of\nCellite, a sandwich of super-thin Dural panels enclosing\na complex aluminium honeycomb. Strong, light and\nextremely stiff, this was developed primarily for the\naerospace industry.\nThe big innovation this time concerned the radiators.\ndeHavilland-style leading-edge intakes fed cool air in,\nwith hot air exiting through top ducts. These, and other\nmodifications, like the endplate bristle-skirt which extended\ndown to track level, functioned to generate two distinctly\nseparate airflow patterns – one beneath the car and another\naround its upper and side surfaces. The result of all this\ndevelopment work, much of it carried out at the Imperial\nCollege wind-tunnel, and led by chief-aerodynamicist\nPeter Wright, was an artificially-created drop in air\npressure beneath the car which literally sucked the car\ndown onto the track. Assisted by conventional wings and\nfins to provide additional stability and balance at speed,\nthe Type 78 was shaping up to be a formidable machine.\nOnce again, Team Lotus opted for Cosworth DFV\npower mated to a Hewland FG400 gearbox, doing so\nafter the car’s original Lotus-Getrag gearbox was quickly\ndiscovered to be too delicate for the task at hand.\nThe team drivers were still Andretti and Nilsson,\nand the new car’s first victory came at Long Beach by\nwhich time each driver had notched up a fifth place – in\nArgentina and Brazil respectively. The US race, however\nreally was a triumph for the new car, and one Andretti\nquickly repeated in Spain where he started from pole\nposition after a superb practice session.\nSetting the fastest lap at Zolder for the Belgian GP\n,\nGunnar Nilsson really found his form, moving through\nthe field before picking off Lauda’s Ferrari to win the wet\nrace, his one and only GP victory. Andretti did likewise in\nthe French Grand Prix (where he also held pole) leaving\nNilsson to pick up fourth. Andretti also won the Italian\nround, while other notable drives for the pair included\na third in Britain (Nilsson) and second at Watkins Glen\n(Andretti). By season’s close the results looked good:\nAndretti finishing third in theWorld Championship\nand Lotus placed second in the Constructors’ Cup.\nMODEL\nType 78\nNAME/FORMULA\nJPS Mk III, Formula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1977-78\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nFord Cosworth DFV\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2993cc/480bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n179in/84.5in/36in\nWHEELBASE\n108.5in\nWEIGHT\n1265lb/547kg\nFormula 1\nType 78\nThe cars continued to race in the early part of 1978, although by then, ill health\nhad forced Nilsson out of Formula 1, his place being taken by Ronnie Peterson, making\na welcome comeback to the team.

Two\nretirements marred the record, but only one was a mechanical failure, the other\noccurring after a collision wrecked Peterson’s suspension in Brazil.\nThese strong results had set the scene for the season and by the Spanish Grand Prix\nAndretti and Peterson both moved into the new Type 79.

A seemingly subtle variant of the Éclat, with\na lower axle ratio and a host of ‘special features’, it was\nsoon out-selling the standard version of both the Éclat\nas well as the equivalent specification Elite.\nIn addition to wider 5.5x13-inch alloy road wheels\n(in place of the regular steel wheels on the 520) shod with\n185/70 Goodyear G800 tyres, a distinctive white livery\nwith a black boot-lid (on some cars) and stripes on the\nbonnet (again, only on some cars and typically not on\nFederal specification cars) and sides, as well as a patriotic\nUnion Jack ‘Sprint’ flag adorning the rear, the Sprint pack\nalso included (on the 520) an oil-cooler and twin exhaust\nsystem – worth a reported seven percent power bonus\nover the standard single exhaust system – the 521 already\nhad this exhaust set-up.\nThe four-speed gearbox and 3.73:1 final ratio was\nretained on the 520 option, but on the 521, which already\nhad the 3.73:1 ratio coupled to the Austin Maxi derived\nfive-speed box, this was swapped out for the 4.11:1 ratio\nfinal drive.

The Éclat Sprint combination of\noptions really did offer a significant enhancement to the\nperformance of the standard Éclat, and road testers\nwere pleasantly surprised.

        "content": "1978\nIn July 1978 Lotus issued a press release detailing\nsubstantial modifications to the Esprit specification and\ndubbed the new car the Series 2. The blade style front\nspoiler was dropped for a more integrated under-bumper\nwrap-around style that let the factory quote a new\naerodynamic Cd figure for the Esprit of 0.335. The top\nspeed claim remained at 138mph, but the most noticeable\ndriving change was apparently enhanced cross-wind\nstability, provided by the integrated front spoiler.\nThe new Lotus-designed, 4-spoke Speedline wheels\nwere a little wider (7-inch front and 7.5-inch rear) than\nthe Series 1 and, partly in an effort to alleviate the lack\nof space under the front bonnet and partly to save costs,\na smaller ‘get you home’ spare wheel was adopted.\nOther external changes included the use of black\nchip-resistant paint on the front spoiler, sill and valance,\nand the addition of protruding engine air intakes\npositioned just behind the rear quarter windows.\n(On Series 1 cars the only air coming into the engine\ncompartment was drawn from underneath the car and\nit was hoped that bringing in cleaner fresher air would\nhelp with engine cooling, as well as clean running in wet\nconditions.) A new style of rear tail light clusters was\ntaken from the Rover SD1 and an Esprit S2 decal\ngraced the rear quarters.\nThe 1973cc, 907 engine remained basically the\nsame apart from a standardisation in camshaft to the\n‘E-Camshaft’ which had been introduced on some of the\nlater Series 1 cars and gave a useful increase in mid-range\ntorque. This seemed to help the Series 2 get closer to the\noriginal performance claims by Lotus and Autocar\nmanaged to get the car up to 130mph and achieve a\n0-60mph time of 8.0 seconds. Ever keen for any publicity,\nLotus Cars announced that the first two production Series\n2 cars were to be delivered to the two contracted Formula\n1 team drivers for 1978, American Mario Andretti and\nSwede Ronnie Peterson.\nThe list price of the Esprit kept on rising and by\nAugust 1978 this stood at a little over £11,000, mainly\ndue it must be said, to the ever increasing rate of inflation\nMODEL\nType 79\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit S2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1978-80\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1060\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 912, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1973cc/160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n165in/73.5in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n2350lb/1066kg\nEsprit Series 2\nType 79\nin the UK at the time. At the NEC Motor Show in October of 1978, the company\nannounced a run of 200 ‘World Champion’ Limited Edition Series 2 cars in its favourite\ncolours of the day, black and gold (below). These would be produced to celebrate the\nexploits of the ‘other’ Type 79 (the John Player Special Team Lotus Formula 1 car)\nin the hands of Mario and Ronnie – eight Grand Prix wins, a 1-2 victory for the driver\npairing in the Drivers’ Championship, and a dominant first place in the Constructors’\nChampionship for Team Lotus.\nAccording to Lotus figures, 100 were officially built for the UK but probably only\naround 81 of the projected 100 for the ‘ROW’ market (55 USA & Canada and 26 rest of\nworld), each with an individually numbered plaque signed by Colin Chapman mounted\non the dashboard. From Lotus production records though, it seems possible that the\ngrand total of ‘Black & Gold’ cars was possibly nearer to that figure of 200 as some cars\nmay have been listed on build records simply as ‘black’, before, in March 1980, the\nupgraded Esprit S2.2 made its public debut.\n"

        "content": "With another two victories falling to the team’s Type 78s during 1978, it also\nushered in a new record for Team Lotus which had taken more chequered\nflags in one season than any team since Mercedes-Benz with their Silver\nArrows in 1955.\nTony Southgate’s return to Shadow and Ralph Bellamy’s departure to join\nthe Fittipaldi brothers Copersucar team, meant Colin Chapman was more\nclosely involved with the development of the Type 79 than with any of its\nimmediate predecessors. Assisted by Ogilvie and Aldridge, he turned away\nfrom more extensive use of Cellite honeycomb sandwiches and devised\ninstead another relatively conventional sheet aluminium monocoque as\nnarrow as was practicable and with a single large fuel cell in the space\nbehind the driver and in front of the engine.\nWinning six World Championship Grand Prix\nraces in a single season, the new Type 79, or\nJohn Player Special Mark IV as it was officially\nknown, did much to secure Colin Chapman’s\nreputation as the most successful racing car\ndesigner in the history of Formula 1.\nBut this return to ‘traditional’ materials did\nnot in any way signify Colin’s rejection of\ncontinual advance and innovation. With Southgate\nand Bellamy now working elsewhere on ‘wing\ncars’ of their own, he was anything but keen to\nabandon his dream and was still determined to\nfind the extra 25 percent of aerodynamic effect\nwhich he calculated had been ‘lost’ as the Type 78\nproject had progressed from wind-tunnel test\nmodel to successful Grand Prix car.\nThis time Colin and his team opted for huge\nbolt-on fibreglass side-pods, so that from above\nthe square-cut machine formed a perfect\nrectangle. Each pod was configured to act as a\ngiant venturi with the air entering at the front and\naccelerating to exit at the rear, where skirts sealed\nthe U-shaped section to maintain the integrity of\nthe underbody low-pressure area. The visual\neffect was stunning, at least with the bodywork\nall in place, and with some justification, the latest\nJPS-liveried car became known in Formula 1\ncircles as “Black Beauty.”\nAmong other mechanical changes, Colin was\nstill determined to move to a smaller, lighter\ngearbox than the old Hewland and opted for the\nexisting Lotus-Getrag gearbox (left), to which was\nadded a new ZF limited-slip differential with\ncrown-wheel and pinions cut by Oerlikon of\nSwitzerland. However, despite the determined\nwork and considerable ingenuity which had gone\ninto the complex sequential change system\n(operating via a separate engagement mechanism\nfor each ratio), the unit proved unreliable and,\nonce again, after extensive testing at Paul Ricard\nin December 1977, the familiar Cosworth DFV\nunit found itself driving through a Hewland box.\nTesting also suggested the need to modify\nthe original monocoque, which was made stiffer,\nwhile other smaller alterations were made to\nimprove the ground-effect aerodynamics Colin\nhad been pursuing. It was in this improved form\nthat the cars made their debut at the non-\nchampionship International Trophy at Silverstone\nand where, in appalling weather, Peterson crashed\nout during the warm-up. Andretti led the field but\nsoon started aquaplaning wildly at Abbey Curve\n1978\nFormula 1\nType 79\nMilestone Car\n“Everybody on the team was highly motivated to create something different, and to\nhave Colin so motivated was a real chance for me to go for the Championship.”\nMario Andretti\nbefore eventually colliding rather heavily with\nanother stranded victim of the same flood.\nThe Type 79’s first championship Grand Prix\nsaw the rebuilt cars at Zolder in mid-May,\nAndretti again taking pole position and this time\nwinning the race outright. While his team mate\nwas held back by a poor pit stop to change tyres,\nAndretti’s perfectly-sorted car had led the race\neffortlessly from start to finish – a welcome gift\nfor Colin who had reached his half-century two\ndays earlier, and one which Peterson celebrated\nby fighting back to take second in his Type 78.\nThis was the fourth time that Lotus had\nsecured a 1-2 Grand Prix result and the fifth came\nonly weeks later when the duo repeated the feat at\nJarama in Spain, both drivers now aboard Type\n79s. After a disappointing Swedish round where\nNiki Lauda won in the infamous Brabham ‘Fan\nCar’, the magic returned with yet another 1-2,\nthis time at Paul Ricard. Andretti went on to win\nthe German Grand Prix at Hockenheim where\nPeterson retired, before Peterson turned the\ntables and won the wet re-started Austrian GP\n,\nhis last Grand Prix victory. The pair secured their\nfourth and final 1-2 of the season at the Dutch\nGrand Prix before the bitter/sweet Italian GP\n,\nwhere an accident tragically claimed the life of\n‘Super Swede’ Ronnie Peterson, whilst Mario\nAndretti claimed the 1978 world title.\nBy the season’s end, the tables had been\nwell and truly turned. Lotus had won the\nConstructors’ Cup with 86 points to Ferrari’s\n58, and Andretti had clinched the Drivers’\nChampionship. Fittingly perhaps, it was Ronnie\nPeterson who took second place, just 13 points\nbehind.\nWhile the team waited for the new Type 80 to\nbe completed, the Type 79 was out again in 1979.\nThe cars were now running in the dark green\ncolours of Martini, the team’s new sponsor, the\nfirst time a Team Lotus Formula 1 car had been\nseen in green since early 1968! However, after\nsome strong early season results for Andretti and\nReutemann, the Type 79 began to be outpaced by\nthe other teams’ improved copies of the original\n‘Ground Effects’ car."

By dispensing with\ndrag-inducing wings, instead relying on modest trim tabs for aerodynamic fine tuning,\nColin estimated that when Mario Andretti took the car out for testing he would gain\nthe equivalent of 50bhp.\nUsing the Cosworth DFV engine with a new gearbox (basically a Hewland FGA in\na unique transversely split Lotus casing mounted between twin venturis), the car carried\nover many features from the Type 79 including driver-adjustable anti-roll bars fore and\naft, near-identical suspension geometry and similar weight distribution.

It had originally been\nhoped to employ titanium for fabricating the upper\nrocking arms as well, but in the event the complex welds\nrequired proved unsuited to the application. Subject to\nlater revision, the brakes were initially placed inboard\nat the rear and outboard at the front.\nKeen to maximise negative lift while minimising drag,\nColin had opted for a long nose section with the side skirts\nextending the entire length of the curved body sides, with\nonly minimal breaks to allow for the suspension. It\nbecame clear in early testing, however, that these skirts\nwould be the source of many problems. Pitching of the\nnose – known as ‘porpoising’, an enduring problem with\nrival Niki Lauda’s Brabham BT48 as well – damaged the\nfront sections of each skirt. In addition, the main skirts\nfrequently stuck in their housings if one end lifted\nsignificantly relative to the other. In this way downforce\nwould be lost, being restored suddenly and at the most\nunpredictable moments – in other words, just when the\ndriver was least expecting it.\nAs always, the team was ready with a pragmatic\nsolution, quickly modifying the skirts and applying wings\nto the nose section in time for Andretti’s team mate Carlos\nReutemann to test the car at Donington. By the time the\ncar was readied for the re-scheduled Race of Champions\nin mid-April, it had gained a rear wing also, although\noil-spill problems forced Andretti back into his Type 79\nfor the race itself.\nWith Reutemann refusing to drive the new car, its race\ndebut finally came at the end of April where, in practice\nat Jarama, Andretti ran skirt-less to qualify fourth fastest,\njust 0.57 seconds behind Jacques Lafitte on pole in his\nLigier. In the race itself, using conventional nose aerofoils,\nhe finished third – a good placing, but sadly no indication\nas to the car’s future performance.\nAt Zolder, a far quicker circuit than Jarama (which\nboasts only one reasonable straight and on the whole\nonly relatively slow corners), Andretti’s car appeared with\na revised centre section and shorter nose without skirts.\nHe qualified only fifth before colliding with the Arrows\nof Jochen Mass, badly damaging the front of his car.\nAndretti, however, was still unhappy with the 80 and\nreturned to his Type 79 for the race. At Monaco, the\npattern was repeated: Mario qualifying only 13th and\nretiring from the race with suspension problems.\nBy now the team was more or less split in two, one\nhalf supporting Reutemann’s efforts in last year’s Type 79,\nthe other trying desperately to make the new Andretti/\nType 80 combination work. The latter contingent failed\nagain badly, however, in the French Grand Prix where\nsevere bounce caused extensive wear to the nose section\nforcing Andretti to switch cars yet again. The spare Type\n80 fared little better and he retired with handling problems.\nAfter the French Grand Prix, Colin at last agreed to\ncall it a day. His team’s results were poor, both his drivers\nwere happier in the old 79 and so probably the most\nelegant Lotus seen, the Type 80 was put into retirement.\nApart from one last test at Paul Ricard, when in an\nattempt to cure the porpoising problems, Steven South\ndrove the car with incredibly stiff springs. With South\nsuffering badly from being shaken around the cockpit,\nChapman began to form the concept of a radical new\ncar in his mind. The Twin-Chassis concept was born."

        "content": "Sunbeam Lotus\nType 81\nAn homologation special built for rallying (but not quite\ncoincidentally an exciting and involving road car), the\nSunbeam Lotus appeared very much in the Vauxhall\nChevette HS2300/Ford Escort RS1600 mould.\n“The perfect embodiment of the new spirit of\nmotoring,” claimed the parent company Talbot’s\nadvertising blurb at the time. With its ‘impeccable\npedigree’ it was planned as a unique specialist vehicle\ncombining high performance, luxury and excellent\nengineering. More significantly, perhaps, it was also to\nprove capable of beating even the mighty Audi Quattro,\ndefeating both German technology and Rothmans’\nmassive financial backing to take the Rally World\nChampionship in 1981.\nThe idea of a rally car for the road appealed\nenormously to the relevant Chrysler (later Talbot) dealer\nnetwork. And for Lotus, the car’s arrival was timely too,\nthe earlier collapse of Jensen having left the company with\na need to find another major customer for its 907-based\nrange of engines.\nMODEL\nType 81\nNAME/FORMULA\nSunbeam Lotus\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1979-81\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2308 (including 10 works rally cats)\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 911, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/150bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150.5in/63in/55.5in\nWHEELBASE\n95in\nWEIGHT\n2116lb/960kg\nWith two names rich in motorsport heritage –\nSunbeam’s many successes may have come earlier than\nthose of Lotus but they were scarcely less distinguished –\nexpectations were high. The basic Talbot Sunbeam was\nsomething of an also-ran in the growing world of the\nhatchback, but the addition of a 2.2-litre (911) version\nof the by now well-proven Lotus two-litre engine, mated\nto a five-speed ZF gearbox, seemed likely to move things\nin the right direction.\nA highly-modified version of the engine currently\nbeing fitted to the Lotus Elite, the 911’s twin-overhead\ncamshaft design aluminium alloy block, cylinder head,\nmain bearing and sump casing brought an exotic flavour\nto Talbot. Management hopes were evidently high that\nthey could recreate something of the road-going magic\nand race-winning performance of the earlier Lotus\nCortina. Echoing the Cortina’s distinctive green and white\ncolour scheme, the new car was to be made available only\nin black and silver with chunky, double-four spoked\nalloy wheels. The revised ‘Series 2’ model would also be\nproduced in an attractive pale blue with either black or\nsilver stripes. Discreet but purposeful, the later cars were\nfurther distinguished by larger headlamps, a revised grill,\nnew door mirrors, a larger fuel tank, minor engine\nmodifications and most distintively, high-mounted circular\nMarchal spotlamps above the bumpers.\nWhen the Sunbeam Lotus went on sale in 1979, only\na limited number of Talbot dealers were appointed to sell\nand service the car – standard practice at the time when\nspecialist cars were built by the mass producers, the\nimplication being that a car of this calibre would require\nthe very best in technical after-sales service and care. The\nintention was clearly to enhance, through association with\nthe marque’s new star, the appeal of the rest of the Talbot\nrange. While the Lotus name was prominently displayed\nin the engine bay and on the car’s flanks, Talbot badges\nand branding were well to the fore on all publicity\nmaterial issued at the time and all warranties on the car were provided by the Talbot\ngroup dealers.\nWith 150bhp at 5,600rpm, the car certainly had the power it needed but much of the\nstandard Talbot Sunbeam remained (including the suspension and drum rear brakes)\nserving to somewhat compromise the car’s overall appeal.\nViewed as a car born in the backroom rather than the marketing department, and\ndriven hardest by a desire to beat Ford’s all-conquering Escort rally cars rather than to\ncreate the perfect hot hatchback, the Sunbeam Lotus did itself credit. Fast, rare, and with\nthe not-inconsiderable cachet of a Rally World Championship (driven by Henri Toivonen\nand Guy Frequelin) to its name, as a sporting hybrid it remains something quite special."

The car being suspended\nfrom the ceiling of the Paradis Latin Nightclub in\nParis, before being slowly lowered onto the stage.\nThat was in December 1979, two months before the\nType 81s of Mario Andretti and Elio De Angelis sat\ntogether on the third row of the grid at the Argentine\nGrand Prix in January 1980, keen to dispel the bad luck\nwhich had dogged the team through most if not all of\nthe previous season.\nThe lack of results in the previous season had caused\nMartini to withdraw its sponsorship and prompted Colin\nto limit himself to the development of a car which was,\nall told, really only an improved version of its somewhat\nproblematic predecessor, rather than another new and\nmore radical contender. Principal funding for Team Lotus\nnow came from David Thieme’s Monaco-based Essex\nPetroleum, the cars running in the sponsor’s striking blue,\nred and chrome colours, but in other respects the new\ndesign seemed unlikely to make as big an impact on\nFormula 1 thinking as many of its forebears.\nThe aluminium monocoque was essentially pure Type\n80, with the same engine and gearbox combination with\nsome minor, but significant, changes to the suspension. It\nwas, agreed Andretti, “a very simple car.” Straight skirts\nreplaced the complex and troublesome curved items\nfound beneath the Type 80, and the body was moulded\nin one piece with straight sidepods.\nIn practice for the Argentine round, Andretti suffered\na brake failure and his new team mate, 22-year-old Italian\nElio De Angelis, the former Shadow rookie, managed\nto qualify in fifth place. In the race however, both were\nforced to retire, Andretti with fuel metering problems,\nDe Angelis with bent suspension.\nFormula 1\nType 81 & 81B\nThe only practical way to make the 907 engine unit in\na larger capacity without the need for a new block was\nto lengthen the stroke from 69.2mm to 76.2mm and\nthus increase the capacity to 2174cc. The extra length of\nstroke gave an appreciable increase in mid-range engine\ntorque, although the officially quoted power output\nremained at the original cars’ quoted figure of 160bhp.\nSince the revised Series 2 Esprit had not been on\nthe market for very long, changes to the cars external\nappearance were kept to an absolute minimum, in other\nwords nothing other than the obligatory ‘Series 2.2’\ndecals on front and rear. The interior also remained\nvirtually unchanged, with just a few new trim options\nand colours. Speedline 4-spoke alloys wheels became\nstandard equipment on the entire Lotus range of cars.\nApart from the new engine, under the skin the big\nchange was the use of a galvanised chassis rather than\nthe unprotected steel chassis of earlier cars which had\nbeen found to rust rather badly around the pick-up point\nfor the rear suspension’s box-section semi-trailing arms.\nDespite these quite significant mechanical changes,\nthe list price for a new S2.2 Esprit was, at £14,951,\nvirtually unchanged from the price of the last of the\nS2 models which were being sold through Lotus dealers\nat £14,884. Less than a year later the price had risen to\n£15,720, making the car an expensive proposition in\ncomparison to its rivals.\nIn April 1981 and after just 93 examples of the\nEsprit S2.2 had been built, production of the original\nbody shape Esprit ended, to be replaced by the\nlong awaited and much needed new shape\nTurbo Esprit (Type 82) and the\n‘Turbo bodied’ but normally\naspirated Esprit Series 3\n(Type 85).\nMODEL\nType 79\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit S2.2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1980-81\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n93\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 912, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n165in/73.5in/43.5in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n2218lb/1006kg\nAnnounced in April of 1980 at the same time as\nthe S2.2 versions of both the Elite and Éclat, the\nrevised Esprit S2.2 (still built under the Type 79\ndesignation) featured the new larger capacity\nversion of the Type 907 power-unit, dubbed Type\n912, as well as an improved (and now galvanised)\nversion of the familiar Lotus steel backbone chassis\nthat was essentially the same as that seen on the\nSeries 1 Esprit launched back in 1976.\nEsprit S2.2\nType 79\nTheeighties\nAfter the loss of Colin Chapman, Team Lotus continued his\nspirit by being the first team to introduce a carbon-fibre chassis\nto Formula 1.

By the opening of the European season with\nthe Belgian GP at Zolder, both drivers were back in their\noriginal shorter wheel based cars.

Andretti, unhappy at the prospect\nof continued failure, moved on to Alfa Romeo, leaving De Angelis and Mansell to carry\nthe colours for Lotus. Their first appearance, still in the blue and silver Essex Team Lotus\ncolours was at Kyalami in South Africa, a FOCA rather than FISA run event, which was\nboycotted by Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Renault and Talbot Ligier. The nineteen Cosworth\nonly powered cars competed at Kyalami, with De Angelis coming in third behind\nReutemann’s Williams, and Mansell tenth – although FISA had already decided to deny\nthe event its World Championship status.\nWith the exception of Mansell’s superb third place at the Belgian GP at Zolder, again\nbehind Reutemann’s Williams-Cosworth and Laffite’s Ligier-Matra – a truly incredible\nachievement in the ageing, heavy and ill-handling Type 81 – this second season held little\npromise for the Type 81. Indeed, by Monaco the team moved on to the Type 87, a\nconventionally-specified machine which utilised elements of the controversial Type 88’s\ncarbon-fibre/Kevlar chassis and relying on the two-year old Type 81 for nothing more\nthan spare parts. The Type 81 was on hand as a spare car at the Spanish GP in June,\na race which saw the re-emergence of John Player as a major sponsor and the reason the\nType 81B seen below was painted in dual Essex/JPS livery. The Type 81 never actually\nraced in JPS livery though."

Intended to boost the engine’s\npower output to an impressive 210bhp at 6,250rpm\n(and requiring a one-inch wider clutch to be fitted\nalong with larger, non-ventilated brakes) the\naddition heralded the arrival of the Esprit as\na genuine 150mph+ Lotus supercar.\nWith two small exceptions, the top half of the\nGiugiaro body shape (above the black trim-line\njoining strip) remained nearly unchanged, but the\nlower half received a re-vamp with the addition of\na new wrap-around front bumper and spoiler\nassembly, new sideskirts, and a pair of NACA-\ntype ducts in the sills to provide additional engine\ncooling. The drag coefficient suffered slightly,\ntaken up to 0.36 Cd. Lotus was keen, however, to\nstress the thoroughness of the completed work.\nThose present at the launch were told “this is\nnot an Esprit with a bolt-on Turbo pack, but a\nfully developed and redesigned motor car in its\nown right.” A new design of the company’s\ntrademark backbone chassis had been\nincorporated to accommodate the modified and\nmore sophisticated suspension. The re-worked\nchassis also had a revised engine bay which\noptimistically, at some future date, would accept\nthe new large-capacity quad-cam V8 (ProjectM71)\nWith progress somewhat delayed by the\ncompany’s huge commitment to outside projects,\nwork on Project M72 – the redesigned Esprit –\nbegan in late 1977. But it was to be February 1980\nbefore Lotus announced the much rumoured\naddition to their model line up of Elite-Éclat-Esprit.\nAlthough a lavish party was held at the Royal Albert\nHall for the launch of the Lotus Turbo Esprit (Essex\nCommemorative Edition), the car was not officially\nreleased until much later that year, and it was\nAugust 1980 before deliveries of the new Type 82\nTurbo Esprit began to hit the streets.\nTurbo Esprit\nType 82\nMilestone Car\n“The Turbo Esprit really took the Esprit concept to its limit. First\nthe chassis outdid the engine, then the engine outdid the chassis.”\nRoger Becker\nengine, the existence of which was at that time\nonly rumoured outside the factory.\nSome of the most distinctive changes, however,\nwere more cosmetic and included a set of black\nlouvers over the engine bay and 15-inch three-\npiece Compomotive road wheels, 7-inch wide at\nthe front and 8-inch at the rear. The prominent\nrear spoiler now affixed at the tail of the upper\nbody was ostensibly added to assist high speed\ncornering, but surely made its biggest impacts\nvisually and by notching up the car’s drag\ncoefficient by three hundredths.\nThe launch party having been funded by the\ncompany’s current Grand Prix sponsor, Essex\nPetroleum, it came as little surprise when, to\nfurther distinguish the car a limited edition\ncommemorative ‘Essex’ version was launched.\nAside from the use of high-quality soft leather\nand the installation of a turbo boost gauge, the\ninterior of the turbo cars remained much as\nbefore, although these so-called Essex versions\nwere fitted as standard with air-conditioning and\na sophisticated Panasonic in-car entertainment\nsystem mounted in a roof console.\nThey also featured the Monaco-based oil\ncompany’s particularly dramatic, although some\nsaid garish, colour scheme of deep blue with red\nand chrome stripes.\nSales of fifty-seven cars in the first year (more\nthan three-quarters of which were sold at home)\nappeared modest for a machine which had been\nso well received by the press.

The new engine being identified as the\nType 912. (To avoid confusion it should be noted that while similar in many respects to\nthe Type 911 engine developed for the Sunbeam Lotus rally car project, this was for\nLotus an entirely new engine.) In fact, the 912 engine offered no more power than its\npredecessor – peak output was still 160bhp, but it was available at 6,500rpm instead of\nthe older engine’s 6,200 – but it gained much needed\ntorque and this was available across a wider spread of the\nvehicle’s range. Fuel efficiency for the car – confusingly\nknown both as the Elite S2 and as the S2.2, for obvious\nreasons – was also much improved.\nMechanically, other changes included chassis revisions\nwhereby the frame remained essentially the same but, was\nnow hot-dipped in zinc to provide corrosion protection.\nThe car gained a new five-speed Getrag gearbox in place\nof the company’s own which had proved to be too\nexpensive to produce. A Borg-Warner three-speed\nautomatic remained on the list of optional extras, but\npriced at £260 it proved no more popular than it had on\nthe Series 1 Elite; Lotus drivers clearly still preferred\nchanging gear themselves.\nExternally, the most obvious modification was to the\nfront spoiler, which now blended in more smoothly with\nthe bodywork as well as the new sills beneath the doors.\nAnd at the other end of the car, the tailgate gained a new\nexternal locking catch and the hatchback wiper was\nremounted into the glass, instead of on the bodywork\nbelow the hatch.\nInside, the cabin was much as before with the same\nbasic controls and instrument layout as on the original\n1974 car but with different trim detailing, new seats and\nnew seatbelts. Even small changes like this meant that\nprices rose accordingly – initially by just £732 (to\n£16,142), although even this modest increase was to look\nslightly unwise against the background of a falling market.\nTowards the end of 1981, and as the factory prepared\nto celebrate the production of its 20,000th quad-valve\nengine, the predicted recession finally hit Britain, and with\nthe Elite S2 now priced at £17,206, sales of the car went\ninto decline: from around 250 in 1979 to perilously close\nto 100 a year later, and by 1981 down to just one a month.\nThe new car may have been better than its predecessor\n(no one doubted it) but the company’s traditional\ncustomers – small businessmen, successful entrepreneurs –\njust did not have this sort of money.\nMODEL\nType 83\nNAME/FORMULA\nElite S2 & Elite S2.2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1980-82\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n133\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 912, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n175in/71.5in/47.5in\nWHEELBASE\n98in\nWEIGHT\n2645lb/1200kg\n1980\nElite Series 2 &S2.2\nType 83\nÉclat Series 2 &S2.2\nType 84\nMODEL\nType 84\nNAME/FORMULA\nÉclat S2 & Éclat S2.2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1980-82\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n223\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 912, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n175in/71.5in/47.5in\nWHEELBASE\n98in\nWEIGHT\n2540b/1152kg\nTime-consuming, frantic, but timely and profitable,\nthe big contracts to develop the Delorean sportscar\nand the Type 81 Talbot Sunbeam Lotus project,\ncertainly delayed revisions to the company’s own\nrange of cars.\nAgainst tough competition a few special ‘Badged\nEditions’ (including Tissot, the F1 teams sponsor) just\nwasn’t enough, and in October 1981 in an attempt to\nkeep sales moving, the company slashed its prices,\nreducing the cost of an Elite by a substantial £1,616 to\nsomething around the £14,500 mark. It worked, but only\nmarginally, and with customers showing preference for\nwhat many felt was the more appealing Éclat shape, the\nchances of survival for the car which had done so much\nto reposition Lotus in the mid-1970s began to fade. Well\nbefore the end of 1982 the last Elite had rolled off the\nHethel productions line.\nHowever, it was the Elite’s close cousin, the Éclat,\nwhich was to lead the sales chart when things got tough.\nWith Elite sales down, it was the coupé whose design and\nconception owed so much to the pioneering hatchback\nthat backed up the Turbo Esprit in sales figures.\nIn 1979 sales of the two cars had been more or less\nequal – in S1 guise that year, 276 Elites were sold to\nBritish buyers compared to 281 Éclats – and for a short\nwhile the following year the balance was actually\nredressed with the Elite outselling the Éclat, albeit by only\na narrow margin. By 1981, however, two-thirds of the\ncompany’s production of four-seaters was for the Éclat. In\nMay 1980 the Éclat was revised and updated in line with\nthe improvements made at the same time to the Elite, and\nit too had been renamed.\nThe Éclat had, at first, been known in Lotus circles as\nthe Elite Coupé while its eventual replacement, that is to\nsay the car which superseded the S2/2.2, was originally\nintended to be known as the Éclat 3.\nAs on the Elite S2, the new 912 engine in the Éclat S2\ngave the same 160bhp power output as its predecessor,\nbut gaining the additional torque it needed across more\nof the engine’s range also improved the car’s overall fuel\nconsumption at a time when the cost of petrol was an\nincreasing concern.\nMechanically the other changes made mirrored the\nElite’ and again the most obvious external modifications\nwere to the front spoiler, which now, following the pattern\nfirst set by the revised Esprit, blended in more smoothly\nwith the bodywork and provided visual continuity with\nnew sills fitted beneath the doors. The suspension and\nsteering remained unchanged although new seven-inch\nwide alloy Speedline road wheels (previously seen on the\n2.2-litre Esprit S2) became standard fitment on the Éclat.\nPrices, fuelled by the UK inflation rate, rose – initially\nby £1,140 (to £15,842) and eventually to £16,751 –\nbefore, against a harsh background of a falling market,\neventually being cut back to £14,850."

The secondary (customary\nstyle) chassis was conventionally sprung to the road wheels\nto give optimum mechanical handling. This chassis unit,\nwhich carried the engine, gearbox and suspension as well\nas the driver, was softly enough sprung and damped to\nensure a comparatively soft ride – in marked contrast to\nthat experienced in the Type 80 by Stephen South, who\nwhen testing the ultimate ‘Ground Effect’ car at Paul\nRicard, had admitted to finding some “difficulty in\nkeeping my feet on the pedals.”\nThe so-called primary chassis, a ladder-type frame\nof steel and carbon-fibre which carried the body and\nsidepods, wings and radiators, and cooling systems, was\nattached to the suspension by another spring system was\nintended to soak up the normal road surface irregularities,\nthereby controlling movement and keeping aerodynamic\nchanges to an absolute minimum.\nAt the time of its completion, the complex new\nconcept was usefully likened to a contemporary heavy\ngoods vehicle. In such a vehicle the suspension is made\nstiff enough to take the required payload but the driver is\ninsulated in a ‘sprung cab’. For the first time in Formula 1,\nclaimed an Essex-Lotus press release at the time, the\ndriver had a ‘sprung cab’.\nWith Nigel Mansell at the wheel for much of the initial\ntesting (Elio De Angelis took over for only a few laps of\nthe Jarama circuit), news of this highly innovative new\ndesign quickly reached FISA. Extremely keen to defend\nits new sliding skirt regulations, the organisation quickly\nissued what it described as a ‘clarification’ of the existing\nregulations – appearing in effect to rule out the new car –\nbut which many in the sport felt instead to be an entirely\nnew rule. “We have no doubt,” reported Autosport\nFormula 1\nType 86\nBy late November 1979, with testing continuing at Paul\nRicard, it was clear that Colin Chapman and his team\nwere falling behind the many technical developments\nunderway within rival teams.\nPerformance was soaring and lap times dropping week\nby week; what Team Lotus had introduced with ground\neffects and sliding skirts, Williams and Brabham had taken\nfurther. In addition the turbocharged cars of another\nteam, Renault, were soon threatening to render\nuncompetitive the normally-aspirated Cosworth DFVs\nof teams like Lotus.\nAgainst this background, Colin abandoned attempts\nto develop the Type 80 to a point where it would be truly\ncompetitive. After FISA moved to ban sliding skirts, Lotus\ninstead began a search for a magic ingredient to resolve\nthe mutual incompatibility of suspension requirements\nbetween those parts of the car which affect its\naerodynamics and those parts which insulate the driver\nfrom the road shocks. Thus was born the concept of two\nseparate chassis with two separate suspension systems.\nAs Formula 1 moved towards almost go kart-like\nparameters with wheel travel reduced to as little as one\ninch, Colin and the team engineers at Ketteringham Hall\nthrew their energies into finding a workable solution to\nthis problem of aerodynamic and suspension loading.\nBefore long he and the team had completed a so-called\n‘technology demonstrator’, the result of three years of\npainstaking and imaginative research and development\nwhich had started with the Type 80. As such, and most\nsignificantly in the light of future events, the car had been\nconceived to meet the FISA regulations of the period\nwhich then permitted the use of skirts.\nmagazine in a December issue, “that the Lotus 86 has been built to comply with the\nrules as written (and) there is little doubt that an attempt will be made to get those rules\nre-written to render it (the new car) illegal.”\nColin Chapman probably felt so too but, was still convinced that he would in time,\nbe able to justify a practical racing version of his Type 86 twin-chassis prototype\n(if only on the grounds that the sport’s governing organisation lacked the power to\nbreak its own regulations, which were subject to a self-imposed two-year stability clause\nadopted concurrently). He thus authorised the team to go ahead with the development\nof a new similarly-configured car, the Type 88, fully believing it would be legal to run\nin the 1981 season.\n"

Sharing the same brakes, it\nalso made sense to offer the car with 15-inch\ndiameter Turbo Esprit wheels as an optional\nextra, although Hethel was careful not to offer the\nfaster car’s dramatic front and rear spoilers and\nside-skirts at any price.\nTo this end, two other changes served to\ndistinguish the S3 from its turbocharged\ncounterpart; namely the adoption of colour-\ncoding for the front spoiler and sill mouldings\nwhich were painted body colour rather than black\n– a small but major improvement to the finished\ncar’s visual appeal. Inside there was little to\ndistinguish it from the earlier Esprit other than\nthe Esprit Turbo’s twin-spoke Momo steering\nwheel and much improved sound insulation.\nPerformance was as before too – the car used\nthe same Type 912 engine as the earlier S2.2 and\nthe identical Citroën Maserati SM-type\ntransmission – but the point about the S3 was not\nthat it was an all-new car. It wasn’t, simply it was\na better car.\nMost significantly though, it was also cheaper.\nThe last S2.2s cost £15,270, but with the launch\nof the new improved Type 85, Series 3 prices\nactually dipped by a substantial 12 percent (more\nthan £1,800) which provided just what was\nneeded, a boost the sales.

At a time when some 4-door\nsaloon cars boasted a 0.30 coefficient of drag,\nrather surprisingly though, the Esprit S3 could\nonly muster a Cd figure of no better than 0.33. Yet\nwhatever criticism could be levelled at Lotus, no\none had ever seriously accused it of not knowing\nwhat it was up to when it came to effective\nengineering – and the one thing which stood out\nabout this car was that it worked so well, in fact\nas an overall package it worked brilliantly.\nWhich perhaps explains why the Lotus board felt\nconfident about once again launching an assault\non the US market.\nIndeed its failure to effectively market the\nElite and Éclat in the US must rank as one of\nthe company’s biggest missed opportunities.\nNow it was hoped that the Esprit S3 and the\nTurbo would give the company another chance,\nparticularly as Lotus had recently signed a deal\nwith Rolls-Royce Inc. in America, to sell cars\nthrough its 68-dealer network. Unfortunately, just\nas the new deal launched, America took a tumble.\nThe Dollar/Pound exchange rate was worse for\nthe US market than it had been for years, and\nforeign car sales nosedived.

        "content": "Although it was the latest and by far the most\nsophisticated ‘conventional’ Lotus ground effect car since\nthe pioneering Type 78/79 models, the Type 87 was in\nreality another stop-gap car, developed in parallel with the\nbrilliant but notoriously controversial Type 88, which –\nas the factory put it at the time – “although not yet proven\nto be ineligible has not been allowed to race.”\nFor its new car, Lotus used the all-new carbon-fibre\nmonocoque, developed for the Type 88. This was a\nsignificant new element, even if one destined to be\novershadowed by the more controversial innovations of\nthe twin-chassis car. It borrowed several features from the\nType 88, including much of its running gear, the intention\nbeing to produce a convincing interim Formula 1 car\nprior to the introduction of a suitably modified Type 88,\nthe Type 88B.\nThe pre-season launch featured the car in the blue, red\nand chrome colours of Essex Petroleum (right). However,\nafter a new sponsorship agreement worth several million\npounds was signed by Imperial Tobacco at Brands Hatch\non 15th June 1981, once again to the fans’ delight, Lotus\ncars were to race in JPS colours. Essex Petroleum, Tissot,\nNGK and Michelin would remain as minority sponsors\nfor the time being, but with the cars contracted to be back\nin their traditional black and gold livery at least until the\nend of the 1984 season. With the driver pairing of Elio\nDe Angelis and Nigel Mansell, Lotus fans had every\nreason to be optimistic.\nIn fact, by the time the sponsorship documents had\nbeen signed, the two drivers had already taken the blue\ncars out at Monaco, the famous street circuit seeming\nwell-suited to the 87’s short wheelbase and narrow track\nwith Mansell qualifying in third place. In the race itself\nthough, he retired with suspension failure, De Angelis\nfollowing him out when his engine failed dramatically.\nHopes were higher for Jarama, the famous black and\ngold back on track, and both drivers eager to perform. It\nsoon became apparent, however, that the Type 87 was not\nthe car to put Lotus back at the front. The drivers finished\nonly fifth and sixth in Spain, and then sixth and seventh\nat Dijon. Silverstone was complicated by the issue of the\nType 88 with De Angelis withdrawing after being black\nflagged, and Mansell unable to even qualify in a Type 87\n(below) that was hastily built up overnight following the\nType 88 disqualification saga.\nNor did things improve in time for the German round\nat Hockenheim. Mansell collided with Gilles Villeneuve’s\nFerrari; De Angelis finished seventh again. In Austria,\nMansell clearly worked hard wrestling with his car to run\nseventh until the engine blew leaving De Angelis, once\nagain, to take seventh place at the flag. At Zandvoort, the\nItalian improved on this by two places, as Mansell retired,\nand at his home GP in Italy, running slightly revised\nversions of the car with a new more conventional\nstyle nose, he finished an improved fourth.\nIn Canada, De Angelis took sixth place despite\nspinning in the wet and having a minor collision with\nVilleneuve, but only after inheriting the slot from his team\nmate who had suffered an enormous high-speed spin of\nhis own before receiving a thump in the rear from Alain\nProst’s Renault. The season’s end came at Las Vegas, and\nfor Mansell at least, produced the Type 87’s best result –\nfourth place after a determined drive, De Angelis having\nearlier withdrawn with a suspected water leak.\nBut the Type 87 was not finished yet and, in modified\nform with wider sidepods and a spacer between the\ngearbox and engine to extend the short wheelbase, the\ncars went out again in early 1982.

Working\nwith DuPont Chemicals, Team Lotus devised a\ncompletely new type of monocoque structure.\nFormula 1\nType 88 & 88B\nscrutineering and performed reasonably well in\npractice. But, before long, proceedings were halted by a\nchorus of disapproval from rival teams and a stewards’\nstatement was issued at 6:00pm on the Friday evening\nbefore the race.\nBriefly, the stewards found for the protesters,\nremoving the car from the race and insisting that the\nType 88’s practice times should not be allowed to stand.\nColin Chapman naturally objected and appealed, being\ngiven leave to start the race on the understanding that,\nshould his appeal be turned down, any points won by\nthe Type 88 would be discounted immediately.\nLegal wrangling aside, the car’s performance at the\nAmerican circuit was far from impressive and on the\nFriday (before De Angelis could really even make much\nof a mark) the car had retired with a broken fuel pump\nleaving the Italian to climb back into his old Type 81\nin a bid to qualify.\nIn Rio the saga was repeated, the car passing\nthrough scrutineering at the Jacarepagua raceway\nbefore six teams – including, most significantly, the\nseason’s leaders Williams and Ferrari – objected to\nthe car and De Angelis once again went back to his\nType 81. In Argentina things failed to get even this far;\nthis time it was the scrutineers who rejected the car,\nprompting Colin and his entourage, furious, to fly out\nbefore the practice sessions had even begun. Colin’s\nintention, said a statement read out at the time, was to\ngo and watch the American Space Shuttle taking off –\nin the hope, he said, of reminding himself about\nmankind’s real technological achievements.\nBy the end of April things looked even worse, with\nColin announcing his decision to withdraw from the\nSan Marino GP as he had insufficient time to prepare\nalternative competitive cars in the light of the ban on his\nType 88.

Growing co-operation with Toyota\nhad given Lotus access to the Japanese company’s vast\nparts bin, but the later purchase of Group Lotus by\nGeneral Motors meant that the Excel would be the\nonly Lotus badged fruit of this union – there was plenty\nof engineering consultancy work between the two\ncompanies, but at the time this was on a strictly\nconfidential basis and little was known outside Hethel.\nThe intention had been to update the ageing but once-\npopular Éclat to improve its aerodynamics, the redesign\nalso enabling the ‘new’ car to run using Toyota running\ngear wherever possible. The standard 2.2-litre engine\nremained much as before but was now bolted to\na new Toyota transmission, essentially the same 5-speed\nunit fitted to the Celica Supra. Lighter than that employed\npreviously\n, and with much lower transmission losses, it was\nmated to a Toyota-sourced chassis-mounted final drive\nunit which proved to be far quieter than on previous cars.\nThe chassis received some modifications, including\ngalvanising, but the essential layout remained as before.\nToyota driveshafts, featuring plunging universal joints,\nreplaced the previous fixed-length shafts. Toyota\nprovided the brakes too – ventilated discs all round –\nwith the rear discs mounted outboard. Inside the car\nlittle had changed, although minor modifications had\nliberated some extra headroom – as much as four inches\nwas claimed at the time – with an optional three-spoke\nsteering wheel in place of the more conventional two\nspoke design.\nThe most obvious changes, of course, were to the\nexterior styling, which, while still recognisably descended\nfrom the Éclat and Elite, received substantial if subtle\nmodifications to the front bumper assembly. This was\nnow softer-edged with the air intakes and spoiler more\nMODEL\nType 89\nNAME/FORMULA\nÉclat Excel\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1982-85\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n872\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 912, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/160bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n172in/71.5in/47.5in\nWHEELBASE\n97.5n\nWEIGHT\n2507lb/1137kg\n1982\nneatly incorporated.

For the Éclat the company had\nclaimed a Cd figure of 0.34; for the new car the figure\nwas said to be down to 0.32 – equal to a seven percent\nimprovement – which when added to the six percent\nincrease in the power transmitted to the road via the\nnew gearbox, meant that both the car’s performance\nand economy received a useful boost.\nPrices dropped too. By October 1982 the price of the\nthen-equivalent Éclat S2.2 was nudging £15,000 – a high\nprice at a time when would-be customers were cutting\nback in a bid to survive a recession – but as a direct\nconsequence of the co-operation with Toyota, the new\nExcel cut this price markedly, shaving well over £1,000\noff the total price to a much more competitive £13,787.\nAt a time when the company’s Formula 1 team was\nalso in the doldrums (its cars had not won a Grand Prix\nsince 1978), the Excel was to prove crucial, especially\nwhen good news arrived after the press had taken the\ncar out for testing. Britain’s Autocar magazine found the\nExcel, with its genuine 130mph top-end, to be faster\nthan any previous front-engined Lotus, and also the\nfastest accelerating with a standing quarter-mile taking\njust 15.4 seconds. It handled brilliantly too: “a completely\nand different and dramatically improved car,” said the\nroad-testers, a “paragon of poise.”\nÉclat Excel\nType 89\n144"

These rams\neffectively replaced the springs, anti-roll bars and dampers\nand were controlled from a central processing unit (or\nCPU) which received telemetric data from a battery of\naccelerometers as well as load sensors and transducers\nmounted on each ram.\nBy analysing the electronic input from these sensors,\nthe CPU was able to build a ‘picture’ of the vehicle’s\nmovements and attitudes.

This meant that the\neffect of wheel travel on the chassis could be controlled,\na more consistent ride height obtained and thus an\nimproved aerodynamic profile arrived at while at the same\ntime reducing the handling changes which inevitably\naccompany the gradual shift from full to light fuel loads.\nTo the eye the car was similar in overall detail to its\npredecessor, the Type 91, the only major difference\nfrom the point of view of the trackside viewer being the\nmore rearward positioning of the engine intake and\nthe somewhat more angular body at the front.\nUnfortunately, however, reaction times for the new\ncar’s sophisticated underpinnings and its reliability in\npractice did not meet the team’s expectations.

The entire\nensemble was then, in the words of the factory press\nhandout, “literally baked at 125C.”\nThe team also announced a switch to radial-ply\nPirellis, to Elf lubricants and to Champion spark plugs,\nbut of course the most important new ingredient was that\ndesignated by the suffix ‘T’ – Renault’s V6, 90-degree\n1,492cc EF1 engine, with twin KKK turbochargers, a\nunique Renault engine management system, and four\nvalves per cylinder actuated by twin belt-driven overhead\ncamshafts on each bank. With the French making the\nmove from thinwall cast iron to lighter aluminium blocks,\nthe engine which was to take Lotus into the ‘turbo era’\nwas a formidable unit: 650bhp at 12,000rpm.\nThe car itself, based on a design which had been\ncompleted just days before Chapman’s death, utilised the\nlessons learned from the Types 87 and Type 91 and was\nprimarily the work of Martin Ogilvie. His new tub was\nnaturally constructed to the highest possible technical\nspecification; even the weaves of the carbon-fibre were\ndesigned to run straight for additional strength. Some\nthought the result ungainly, but Ogilvie was quick to\ndefend it, highlighting the elegance of its ‘simple yet\ndistinctive shape’ and admitting that it looked nothing\nlike any of its competitors. “Colin actually styled the car\nhimself,” claimed Ogilvie, “basing it on the angular lines\nof his road cars – it’s a credit to his genius.”\nThe new Renault engine was mounted as a stressed\nmember, on the back of the new tub, as per the earlier\nCosworth-engined cars, but with some additional tubular\nbraces. A larger fuel tank was also incorporated along\nwith larger-caliper brakes to cope with the additional\npower of the blown V6 and the reduced engine braking\neffect. Ogilvie also chose to retain the traditional long\nsidepods (despite the fact that many rival teams were\nswitching to shorter ones) designed to contain the\ncombined water/oil radiators as well as the now\nrequired water/air intercoolers.\nA new pull-rod suspension geometry used an\narrangement of inboard coil-spring damper and pivoting\nactuating arms which had the advantage over earlier\nsystems of minimising aerodynamic disturbance and\nincreasing the overall front-end rigidity.

Thereafter, Ducarouge sought only to devise a car that would be both light and\neasy to drive. With smaller sidepods and relocated ancillaries, hence the taller, slimmer\nshape, the car’s suspension was virtually unchanged from the Type 93T’s pull-rod\narrangement. But it now employed new Brembo brakes from Italy and also saw a return\nto Goodyear tyres. Substantial use of carbon-fibre and Kevlar, by now something of\na Lotus standard, ensured the car was down to the 540kgs minimum weight limit.\nWith Lotus, Renault Sport and Ligier on board, the same V6 engine was now in use\nby three teams (quite literally too: each team drawing its engines from a central pool),\nRenault proving its various modifications worked in one team car before passing them\nonto the second Renault Sport car and, at the same time, to those of its client teams.\nUnveiled on December 20th 1983 at the\nimpressive Lotus France showroom near the\nArc de Triomphe in Paris, the new smaller and\nlighter John Player Special liveried Type 95T was\nthe company’s third generation turbocharged\nFormula 1 contender.\nThough less powerful than some of its closest rivals, it\nwas still an impressive engine. The new regulation for fuel\ntank allowance, (now cut to 220-litres for the entire race\nand no refuelling), meant that its fuel economy took on\neven more importance.\nThere were concerns that the Goodyear radials might\nnot be fully competitive with the Michelins run by the all\nconquering McLarens – an important consideration when\nweighing up the benefits of hard and soft tyres and the\nresulting impact on pit lane strategies – but against this\nthere seemed little doubt that the Type 95T was the best\nhandling chassis of the season.

Over the year they\nhad taken pole position twice and started from the front\nrow no fewer than six times. While never quite in the\nrunning for the Drivers’ Championship, Elio De Angelis\nwas nevertheless well-placed for a runner’s up slot and his\nimpressive consistency eventually brought him and the\nteam twelve finishes in just sixteen races, securing third\nplace in the Championship.\nBy season’s end, however, much of this was set to\nchange. Nigel Mansell left for pastures new at Williams.\nRenault and its massive R&D budget agreed to stay with\nTeam Lotus, and the young Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna\nsigned up to join the team, moving from Toleman. In\nsummary, the future looked promising indeed."

        "content": "In 1984 a welcome request from the American\nbusinessman and former Formula 2 team owner Roy\nWinkelmann asking Team Lotus to build him a new\nchallenger for North America’s PPG/CART Indycar\nseries, brought Lotus and Cosworth back together again,\nthe result being the striking 720bhp Type 96T\n.\nThe car was intended to take the Norfolk-based team\nback to United States where, with Jim Clark behind the\nwheel, the team had won the Indianapolis 500 back in\n1965. Also, as only four drivers had ever managed to\nwin both the ‘Indy 500’ and the Formula 1 World\nChampionship, and as all of them – Clark, Hill, Andretti\nand Fittipaldi – had driven Team Lotus cars to take their\nworld title, this new venture was also sure to revive happy\nmemories for race fans as well as Lotus watchers the\nworld over.\nWinkelmann himself was an experienced hand at\nracing, running Brabhams in the mid-1960s and later in\nthe decade enabling Jochen Rindt to establish himself as\nthe man to beat in Formula 2. Having withdrawn from\nthe scene in 1970, in time he felt lured back to the track\nand saw an opportunity in CART racing, but wished to\nfind an alternative route which did not involve buying an\noff-the-shelf chassis from UK builders such as March\nor Lola like everyone else.\nAccordingly, he approached Team Lotus and\nannounced his intention to start a three-year programme\nto compete in and conquer CART\n, with a combination\nof Lotus chassis, Cosworth DFX turbocharged engine\nand a big-time, big budget sponsorship deal.\nGerrard Ducarouge proposed a modified Type 95T\ntub, built along similar lines to the Formula 1 car but more\nsubstantial overall, made thicker and stronger where it\nneeded to be in order to meet US series regulations and\nMODEL\nType 96T\nNAME/FORMULA\nIndycar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1985\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1\nENGINE TYPE\nTurbocharged Cosworth DFX V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2643cc/720bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n181in/80in/41.5in\nWHEELBASE\n110in\nWEIGHT\n1503lb/682kg\nto allow for the very real possibility that one of these\n200mph+ cars could hit a concrete retaining wall on\none of the super-fast banked ovals used in the USA.\nInstantly recognisable as a tidy and attractive\nDucarouge design, the essentials of the new car were\nmuch as before and featured a carbon/Kevlar sandwich\nwith ‘pre-impregnated’ skins, but with a lightweight\naluminium-foil honeycomb in place of the traditional\nNomex paper. This element was the most significant\nmodification, serving as it did not only to build in extra\nstrength but also to lay the foundations for future Team\nLotus Formula 1 tubs. The suspension was similar to\nthat fitted to the Type 95T – utilising pull-rods, double\nwishbones and inboard coil-spring/damper units –\nalthough these too had to be strengthened to cope\nwith the additional loads imposed.\nAt this stage, however, and with just the one\nprototype chassis completed, the politics of motorsport\nintervened. While foreign domination of one sort seemed\nacceptable to the Americans – their domestic CART\nracing series was built almost entirely around one very\nEnglish engine and two good English chassis designs –\n‘works’ cars running ‘works’ engines of the type proposed\nby the British-born Winkelmann were anything but\nwelcome at the time. It was clear that the racing\nestablishment in the US was not keen to see things change\nand the businessman soon began to experience difficulty\nsecuring sponsorship deals for the ‘controversial’\nWinkelmann Team Lotus. Before long, the once-\npromising Type 96T project was in trouble. Winkelmann\nreturned to his substantial non-racing business interests\nand Team Lotus went home with the one and only Type\n96T\n. Incredibly elegant but never raced, and rarely seen in\npublic, within a year the car was no longer eligible under\nthe new US racing regulations. Thus it became little more\nthan a hint of something which might have been – strong\nechoes there of the infamous 4-wheel-drive Type 64 –\nleaving some to say, “If only...”\nIndycar\nType 96T\n"

For\nthe first time, carbon-fibre brakes were fitted as standard.\nAnother logical progression for Lotus, the new car in fact had much in\ncommon with the 95T\n, but profited too from lessons learned during the\nteam’s involvement with the ill-fated Type 96T project. There was the\nstronger Lotus Indy-style gearbox, in use for the first time. Also a stronger\nconstruction, the deformable nose box, was now able to withstand being\nsmashed into a concrete wall at ten metres per second – something\ndemanded by the latest regulations – with each team being required to\nprovide actual certification to prove their cars passed the test. And finally,\nfollowing a ban on rear wing winglets, the new car also sported mini-\nwinglets on the rear of each side pod – an idea Ducarouge had happened\nupon during his observations of US racing while preparing plans for the\nType 96T Indycar project.\nThere was another aerodynamic innovation too: tiny curved aerofoil-\nsection vertical vanes situated between the front wheels and the tub sides.\nThought by contemporary commentators to clean up turbulence in this area\n(Lotus refused to confirm or deny this), and so reduce drag around the front\nwheels, their design was quickly copied by most of the rival teams.\nThe cars ran an assortment of engines, using at various times throughout\nthe season the EF4B (the low compression of which was excellent for high-\nboost qualifying sessions but which carried with it the penalty of higher fuel\nconsumption) and the latest EF15 power unit. The higher compression of\nthis second engine, developed against the background of the 220-litre fuel\nrestriction, would not tolerate the same stresses as the older unit, so that\nafter qualifying with the EF4B-engined cars, the team would switch to the\nnewer engines for the race itself, with new rear-end assemblies fitted to\nreplace those possibly compromised by the high stresses of qualifying.\nSupplied by a Renault sub-contractor, Bourges-based Mecachrome, each\nengine averaged a scant 270 miles before a complete rebuild was needed.\nWith a new driver and another new car, hopes\nwere high as Team Lotus readied itself for the\n1985 season. The driver was Nigel Mansell’s\nreplacement Ayrton Senna, a Brazilian who had\nattracted favourable comparisons with the likes\nof Clark and Stewart, and who already had a\ncredible Formula 1 season under his belt with\nthe underfinanced Toleman team.\n1985\nFormula 1\nType 97T\nIn retrospect at least, it is perhaps no surprise\nto learn that the young Senna emerged with such\ncredit from the early rounds of the season. He\nwas clearly a driver with massive potential.\nLeading the field at Detroit, the Nürburgring,\nBrands Hatch and Adelaide, as well as at Imola\nand Silverstone, (both at which he ran out of fuel\nin sight of the flag) he quickly became a favourite\nof race fans the world over, if not always with\nhis fellow drivers.\nTaking pole seven times in the first season –\nDe Angelis managed only one – Senna’s driving\nstyle was tough but unmatched when it came to\nachieving what was needed. His first GP win, a\nsuperb drive in appallingly wet conditions, came\nat Estoril for the Portuguese Grand Prix. A second\nwin followed at Spa Francorchamps.\nElio De Angelis proved as consistent as ever\nbut, clearly overshadowed by the newcomer,\nMilestone Car\n“This is a stronger, more refined and developed version of an\nalready good car. I am even more confident than last year.”\nPeter Warr\ngradually slipped down the ranks. There was to\nbe one more win for the Italian, inherited after\nProst’s McLaren was disqualified for being under-\nweight after the San Marino race, but the 1985\nseason was still a sad end (as many observed at\nthe time) for a driver who had served Team Lotus\nso well and for so long.\nFor the Type 97T\n, however, it was something of\na triumphant year. With just four chassis to play\nwith for the entire season (some were damaged,\nbut none written-off) Team Lotus may not have\nmanaged to put much of a dent in the McLaren\npoints total, but it did manage to score three\nvictories – the first of the post-Chapman era.\nHaving built 21 of its clever and pioneering\ncarbon composite series chassis and not yet lost\na single one, Lotus was now winning races with\nthem too. The team from Norfolk was back in\nthe running; of that there could be little doubt.\n152"

        "content": "Unveiled in London on 3rd February 1987, the\nnew Lotus Type 99T was the first Lotus Grand\nPrix car to be Honda-powered and, according\nto Gerard Ducarouge, was “a classic car based\non the previous three.” Using the turbocharged\nHonda V6s, the 80-degree RA166-E then later\nthe RA167-G – both substantially more powerful\nthan the ageing Renault plants – it saw a return\nto the method of construction used prior to\n1986, the Lotus monocoque once more being\nbuilt up using a folded single carbon-fibre/\nKevlar composite sheet.\nThe car was, according to Ducarouge, “a much refined development of\nour previous designs, 95T\n, 97T and 98T\n. The difference in the new car is\nnot really on the surface but under the skin [as] we had to produce a new\ncarbon-fibre/Kevlar chassis designed to accommodate the Honda engine.\nWe followed our well-tried and tested formula in the design, in order to\ntry to get the best from the Japanese engine.” The very wide power range\nof this high-revving engine, required the development by Lotus and\nHewland of a new six-speed gearbox. At the same time, the increased\nvibration of the engine meant it was necessary to strengthen the entire car.\nBeside the new engine supplier, the most\nsignificant change to the car’s make up was the\nadoption again of the computer-controlled\n‘active’ suspension system, which had been under\ndevelopment at Lotus since before the days of the\nType 92. Powered by a hydraulic pump driven via\na mechanical coupling to the rear of the left-hand\nside exhaust camshaft, it distributed hydraulic\nfluid to each suspension corner via a network\nof pipes with hydraulic actuators, controlled\nby electronically-operated pressure controlling\nvalves. Pull-rods and wishbones were employed\nin the actual geometry but, used in place of\nconventional coil-springs, the hydraulic actuators\nwere the only true suspension medium.\nThe biggest problem was accommodating the\nancillaries which came with the new engine. This\nmeant more wiring and more plumbing for\nadditional sensors and control boxes, although\nthe different cooling requirements of the Honda\nenabled engineers to opt for just one oil/water\nheat exchanger (in place of a pair) connected\ndirectly to the engine.\n1987\nThe team conducted extensive wind tunnel\ntests to determine the slippery shape of the new\ncar, but the big news was the new sponsor, the\ntobacco company RJ Reynolds’ Camel colours\nreplacing those of John Player Special in the\nnewly named Camel Team Lotus Honda.\nAccordingly, a new Japanese ‘second string’ driver\nSatoru Nakajima was signed up to accompany\nestablished team star Ayrton Senna.\nEven in Camel’s distinctive yellow and blue\nlivery, the car bore a strong family resemblance to\nits predecessors, although, with a smaller engine\ncover, narrower side pods and no windscreen, it\nwas a slightly sleeker machine with some subtle\naerodynamic modifications made to the sidepods\nand gearbox underbody area.\nThe season got off to a poor start, however,\nwith Senna retiring at Brazil. He managed to take\npole at San Marino but, concerned by continuing\nfuel supply problems, lost the lead to the Williams\nof Nigel Mansell and settled for second. Another\nbrush with Mansell, this time a collision, took\nhim out of contention at Spa, but once again he\ndrove brilliantly at Monaco to take the flag. He\nrepeated the feat at Detroit, taking first place and\nmarking the 79th and, ultimately, final Grand Prix\nwin for Team Lotus.\nThird in both the British and Germany rounds,\nand fourth in the French Grand Prix, Senna’s car\nwas modified in time for the Hungarian round\nwith a lower, narrower cockpit and lower\nsidepods. Three more second places came at\nFormula 1\nType 99T\nImola, in Japan and in Australia – although the\nlast was later disallowed after scrutineers\nobjected to the car’s brake-cooling ducts. In\naddition, the Brazilian scooped fifth in Austria\nto come home third in the final World Drivers’\nChampionship points standings, behind Nelson\nPiquet’s Brabham and Nigel Mansell in the\nWilliams. Lotus took third place in the\nConstructors Cup, again behind Brabham\nand Williams.\nHonda favourite Nakajima could not, of\ncourse, compete with Senna’s pace, but was\nin the points at Imola (fifth) and at Spa (sixth),\ncoming fourth behind Senna, albeit a lap down,\nat Silverstone and another sixth at his home GP\nat Suzuka.\n156"

In fact, the difference between\nthe Esprit Turbo and the normally aspirated (n/a) base\nmodel was hard to spot for almost anybody except the\nreal hard core Lotus enthusiast.\nThe new style car (Esprit and Esprit Turbo), code\nnamed X180 by the factory, had been the work of a team\nof designers under the control of Lotus design director\nColin Spooner and led by Peter Stevens, ably supported\nby Ken Sears. The fruits of their work were first seen\nwhen the new shape car was launched at the British\nMotor Show in October 1987, with delivery of the first\ncars going out to customers almost immediately.\nWith the car being primarily a new bodyshell on\ntop of an existing and well proven chassis/engine\ncombination, its development from start to finish had\ntaken just 15 months, an incredibly short time to design\nwhat to the outside world, seemed to be a new car.\nThe more rounded shape of the new body made the\nold sharper edged ‘flat paper’ style Giugiaro car look\npositively obsolete almost overnight and although it\nlooked far smoother than before, its drag coefficient of\n0.35 was in truth slightly higher than the old car’s 0.34\nfigure. The overall dimensions of the new car varied by\nno more than one inch at any given point from the latter\nturbo models, an incredible fact given that the car looked\nso different from what was now basically a 12-year old\ndesign and every pane of glass in the car was a new shape\nand size. One of the major changes to the overall body\npackage was the inclusion of a lift out body panel in the\nroof which could be fixed in a raised position giving the\ncabin some much needed ventilation. In fact, the car\ncould even be driven without the roof at all, although\nstowing the panel elsewhere in a custom-made carry\ncase used up most of the rear luggage space.\nExternally, the Type 85 (n/a) model differed from\nthe Type 82 Turbo model in several respects, the major\ndifference was only visible from the rear three-quarter\naspect, where on the large glass panel covered most of\nIn 1987, the change to the new ‘Peter Stevens’\ndesigned body shape for the Esprit, meant that\nmany people thought that the Type 85 normally\naspirated model would disappear forever.\nNothing of the sort was about to happen though,\nand the dependable base model Esprit was set\nto continue alongside the Type 82 Esprit Turbo\nfor the foreseeable future.\nthe area between the ‘flying butress’ side body sections on\nTurbo model was omitted. The n/a car also had different\nrear under-body section, with matt black sills and door\nmirrors. The most noticeable change over the previous\nType 85 (apart of course from the new body shape), were\nthe cars distinctive new multi-spoked cast alloy road wheels.\nAt the front end the new n/a and Turbo models once\nagain differed quite subtly, with the base Type 85 being\ndevoid of the extra driving lamps offered as standard\nequipment on the turbo model (although as an ‘option’\nn/a cars were frequently supplied with these lamps fitted),\nas well as having a much cleaner and more simple air\nintake. From the side elevation, apart from the differing\nwheels, almost the only way to identify one car from the\nother was by the Esprit Turbo badge behind the door on\nthe Type 82, in contrast to the more subtle ESPRIT decal\nplaced on the rear quarter-light window of the Type 85.\nThe Type 85 also featured a small ‘Lotus Design’ badge\nplaced above the trim line just ahead of the doors and\nabove the now obligatory side flashers (located ahead of\nthe wheel-arch on the bumper on US cars), although\nthis badge also appeared on some turbo cars.\nUnder the skin things remained pretty much as they\nhad been on the old shape car, although with the\nabandoning of the HC model specification all models of\nthe n/a were now fitted with the standardised 172bhp\n2.2-litre engine. As on the Turbo, the Citroën gearbox was\nreplaced by a modified high-torque Renault five speed\nmanual transaxle. This unit was also being fitted to the\nrear-engined Renault GTA and it was felt that long term\nsupply was secure enough that other changes needed to\nuse the ‘box could be made cost effectively. Using the\nRenault unit meant that the rear brake assembly units\nwhich had always been mounted alongside the gearbox\nwould need to be moved to an outboard position for the\nfirst time on an Esprit. The interior styling remained\nmuch as before, with a supposedly ‘new style’ instrument\npanel and a much more integrated facia. With the slightly\nrevised bodyshell offering a touch more legroom and\nan improved ventilation system, not to mention the\nremovable roof section, the Esprit continued as a\nhighly-respected world-class supercar!\nMODEL\nType 85\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit n/a\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1987-92\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n286\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 912, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/172bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n165in/73.5in/44.5in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n2352lb/1067kg\n158"

        "content": "Esprit Turbo\nType 82\nGaining a substantially new bodyshell but no new Type\nnumber, the 1987 edition of the Type 82 Esprit Turbo\nowed its new look to stylist Peter Stevens. He would\nbecome well known for his involvement with a number\nof headlining future projects, including the Type 100\nElan for Lotus, the Jaguar XJR-15 road/race car, and\nprobably most of all, the BMW V12-powered, three-seat\nMcLaren F1 supercar.\nWhile time constraints prevented him being offered\nthe freedom to start a new car from scratch, Stevens\nnonetheless was able to redraft and rework the car’s basic\nshape to such an extent as to give the Esprit a completely\nnew lease of life. Indeed, the original Esprit having first\nseen the light of day as early as 1972, it speaks well for his\nwork that, albeit in a much revised form, the Esprit was\nstill in production (and still looked current) more than\na quarter of a century later.\nNow re-christened the Esprit Turbo, the car’s more\nrounded profile retained the essential qualities of the\nGiugiaro design but was more refined. Softer at the edges\nand set off nicely by distinctive OZ manufactured (in\nItaly) 5-bolt, 7-spoke directional alloy wheels, it sat more\nhappily alongside more recently designed rivals such\nas the Pininfarina-styled Ferrari 328GTS.\nPower still came initially from the Type 910 engine –\nwet-sump lubricated since 1983 – but now fitted with\na charge-cooled version (see page 161 for more on\nchargecooling) of the Lotus 2.2-litre turbo engine with\nelectronic fuel injection in place of the original pair of\ntwin-choke Dellorto carburettors and developing 265bhp.\nAs with the Type 85 Esprit, the long lived Citroën-\nMaserati gearbox of the original Esprit models (including\nthe Turbo) finally disappeared, to be replaced by a\nmodified, high-torque Renault five-speed manual\ntransaxle that was shared with the Renault Alpine GTA.\nThe design changes – most obvious in the rounded\nexterior, but worthwhile alterations were also evident in\nthe cabin to make it a little more hospitable and flexible,\nparticularly for taller owners – had an immediate effect\non production. The new look led to doubled sales rates\nfor normally aspirated Esprits and almost tripled turbo\nproduction output when 1988 sales were compared\nto those of 1986.\nIn a successful assault on wind noise, glazing updates\nmodified the side-glass and added double seals to the\nwindow frames. A removable panel in the roof was\nsupplied either in composite Nomex honeycomb or\nas a tinted glass sun roof. The Turbo and normally\naspirated Esprits were easily differentiated by the use\nof a large single glazed pane between the uprights of\nthe ‘Flying Buttress’ rear end on the Turbo model, that\nleft a small opening at the bottom to help with airflow\nand giving what Lotus called a ‘tunnel-back’ feel. That\nglass pane was omitted on the cheaper Esprit. A new\nengine cover, rear number plate surround and different\nvalance beneath the rear bumper were all unique\nitems for turbo models too.\nAt the front the Esprit Turbo carried fog lamps as\nstandard and subtly functional panels to allow extra air\nintake to the cockpit, where air management was much\nimproved. Flaps now covered the fuel tank fillers on the\nhindquarters, and the old air-intake slots around the\nenlarged rear windows were blended more smoothly into\nthe overall shape, although the intakes on the lower side\nsills survived. The aerodynamic drag factor was quoted\nas 0.35Cd for the rear-glazed Turbo and 0.36Cd on the\nslower Esprit, surprisingly up slightly over the earlier model.\nWhereas the side sills and areas under both front and\nrear bumpers was body-coloured on the new Type 85\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit Turbo\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1987-88\nEXAMPLES BUILT\napprox. 250\nENGINE TYPE\nTurbocharged Lotus 910S, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/265bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n165in/73.5in/45.5in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n2653lb/1203kg\nnormally aspirated cars, turbocharged cars were painted metallic silver-grey in those\nareas, which set them apart until the end of production in 1990.

Cockpit noise\nwas contained, especially for the turbo variants and the extra all-up weight seemed\na fair price to pay for considerably more civilised cabin noise levels.\n"

Carrying the coveted number one\n– for the first time in many years for Team Lotus –\nthe new car was unveiled with the customary\nLotus fanfare and the statement “Dramatic\nnew slim line car set to win with Piquet in 1988.”\nThe previous year’s World Champion, Nelson Piquet\nwas typically bullish about his chances. “There is some\nstiff competition, as always, but I don’t see why I can’t\nwin a fourth championship this season. After a long break\nbetween seasons,” he added, “I am really looking forward\nto getting back into a racing car – especially this one as\nit’s a completely new design.”\nThe arrival of this extremely prestigious new number\none driver (replacing Senna, who had defected to McLaren)\nwas just part of the impressive arrangement with main\nsponsor R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International, who stayed\nwith the team for a second season, contributing their\nCamel brand’s livery. Additional money came in from Elf,\ncomputer company Epson, and also the British textiles\ngroup Courtaulds. Satoru Nakajima rounded out the\ndriver pairing, also starting his second season with\nCamel Team Lotus.\nMODEL\nType 100T\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1988\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nHonda RA 168E V6 turbo\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1495cc/800bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n168in/84.5in/40.5in\nWHEELBASE\n109in\nWEIGHT\n1188lb/539kg\nWhile still Honda V6-powered, the all-new Camel\nLotus Type 100T was slightly less bulky than its\npredecessor and very different as a consequence of this\nand its lengthy development programme which stretched\nback to mid-way through the previous season.\nWearing Piquet’s coveted number one, the car’s\ndistinctive elongated nose was the result of both the new\nregulations (demanding that the drivers’ feet be positioned\nbehind the front wheel centre-line) and the many\nFormula 1\nType 100T\n1988\nhundreds of hours the prototype had spent in the\nComtec wind tunnel near the Silverstone circuit. Along\nwith the 2.5-bar evolution of Honda’s successful V6\nengine, the car’s setup employed a brand new gearbox\nalong with the familiar chassis which returned to a\n‘passive’ sprung suspension damped by Bilstein gas-filled\nshock absorbers.\nLotus apparently wished to concentrate its efforts on\ndeveloping the ‘active’ suspension for production cars,\nso the new car was, according to Technical Director\nDucarouge, “a very classic racing car design. We have\npaid special attention to efficiency in both the mechanical\nand aerodynamic departments.” Bilstein’s input was\ncrucial too, as Ducarouge admitted at the car’s launch,\n“we have lost a lot of ground in the field of suspension\nsystems while we were off developing active suspension.”\nWith its stretched nose the car looked much longer\nthan it actually was, an illusion strengthened by the more\nrearward location of the driver’s seat. This was another\nresult of the new regulations that demanded the driver’s\nfeet be behind the front axle. In fact, it was only\nfractionally longer than the Type 99T\n.\nAt the start of the season in Brazil, Piquet and\nNakajima finished well, in third and sixth places\nrespectively. Piquet pulled another third out of the hat\nat San Marino, but both drivers were forced to pull out\nof the Mexican round. Nakajima failed to qualify at\nMonaco, and again at Detroit – where Piquet (already\ndown in the points after coming only fourth in Canada) –\nwas out after an accident. Two fifth places followed (for\nPiquet) in France and in Britain, with a third in Australia\nand a sixth place at Spa. But nothing more for Nakajima,\nand indeed nothing more for the Type 100T which could\nonly bring Team Lotus home fourth in that years\nConstructors’ title race.\nWhat went wrong? It is hard to say. Certainly as the\nseason wore on, the World Champion’s performance\nbecame a lot less impressive than the team had hoped for.\nIt was also felt that Team Lotus had been misled by the\nreams of possibly incorrect data it had compiled from the\nmany hundreds of hours spent with the prototype in\nthe wind-tunnel at Comtec."

If Lotus had a first\n‘world car’, the Esprit SE was that machine.\nKey components of the revised car were assembled around the 910S-\ncoded version of the familiar 4-cylinder, 16-valve unit with its single Garrett\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit Turbo SE\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1989-92\nEXAMPLES BUILT\napprox. 1600\nENGINE TYPE\nTurbocharged Lotus 910S, 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/265bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n165in/73.5in/45.5in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n2653lb/1203kg\n1989\nTB03 turbocharger, the latter complete with\nwater cooling and integral wastegate adopted in\nprevious editions. The big changes were the\ninstallation of Delco Electronics’ GMP4 engine\nmanagement that superseded the previous\nAmerican emission specification and the more\nstringent European emission specification for\nmarkets like Switzerland. The latter gave 228\nhorsepower but was a low volume item sold only\nfrom September 1988 compared to the US Bosch\nfuel injection variants spanning 1985-1988.\nThe big bonus with GMP4 electronics and the\nnew distributor-less twin coil ignition system\nwas that the turbocharged twin-cam motor could\nrelease more reliable power on low-grade, (95\nRON minimum) unleaded, fuels. The second\nmajor alteration, which increased power output\nby 14 percent and torque by 17 percent (totalling\n264bhp and 261lbft respectively – to a remarkable\n121.5bhp per litre), was a turbocharger and\nintercooling system that Lotus dubbed\n‘Chargecooling.’ Connecting turbocharger\ncompressor output to the plenum intake nozzle\nvia a finned Behr water-to-air intercooler with\nits own plumbing (i.e. not shared with the motor),\nthe chargecooler itself was compact. Its pure\nwater coolant was driven by an ancillary Jabsco\npump slotted into the redundant distributor drive,\nfeeding a separate front radiator of considerable\ncooling capacity.\nEsprit Turbo SE\nType 82\nChargecooling did not just enhance steady\nstate output from 225 to 264bhp at peak (6500)\nrpm, it also allowed Lotus to engineer a\ntemporary (under 30 seconds) overboost system.\nHere outputs on 95 octane fuel could reach 280bhp\nunder sudden full throttle demand. More\nimportantly, pulling power (torque) was enhanced\nover a wider engine speed range: from 2400rpm to\n7000rpm over 210lbft of torque was supplied, that\nwas 10lbft more than the original Turbo power\nunit supplied at a peak rpm of 4500.\nAlthough the 5-speed Renault gearbox was not\nchanged, a new official rev limit of 7400rpm (up\nfrom 7000rpm), allowed 60mph to be exceeded in\nsecond gear, with more than 100mph delivered in\nthird. The clutch diameter remained at 9.25inch/\n235mm but the spring clamp loads of the\nhydraulically-operated unit were raised.\nAerodynamics and handling were Lotus\nengineering specialities of the period, and they\nsurpassed themselves on the SE. Aerodynamics\nwere most visible in the rear wing that mounted\ndirectly on the lifting tailgate (a high mounted\nversion of which appeared briefly in 1991) and\nthe re-profiled under bumper contours and air\nintakes at the front end. These serviced not just\nthe engine radiator/chargecooler heat exchanger/\nair conditioning condenser stack, but also twin\noil-coolers at either side. The latter also had an\nair induction feed onto the front brakes. The rear\nflanks of the car of course featured the addition\nof SE badges alongside the Turbo."

        "content": "1989\nThe January 1986 takeover of Lotus by General\nMotors effectively terminated any plans for a\nToyota-engined sports car, but plans were still\nafoot for a successor to the Elan. With some\n£35 million available to be invested in the\nproject, this represented the largest such single\ninvestment in the company’s 43-year history.\nThe intention was to produce between 3,000 and 3,500\nElans a year, a substantial increase over normal Lotus\nlevels and a stated desire to see the company producing\nsome 4,500 combined units annually by the mid-1990s\n(a marked contrast to the 1981 total of just 345 cars).\nThe first priority for Lotus design director Colin\nSpooner was finding a suitable powertrain, preferably\none which was not yet in production rather than an\nestablished unit. It was to be Isuzu who came up with\nthe goods, namely a new-generation 16-valve, 1.6-litre\nstraight-four, suitable for front wheel-drive applications\nand with an excellent power-to-weight ratio. Front wheel\ndrive was to be the car’s ‘big idea’, a bid to appeal to a\ngeneration which had grown up with hot-hatchbacks,\ndrivers keen to try something new but who would wish to\nstay with the sort of driving experience they understood.\nThe chassis, almost inevitably, was yet another variant\nof the company’s traditional steel backbone only this\ntime fabricated using several rectangular box sections,\nall accommodating a unique composite body. The latter\nwas made not by glueing together two halves but by\nassembling numerous small mouldings made of a new\nnon-shrink polymer developed by Ashland Chemical\nCompany of Columbus, Ohio. The body’s overall shape,\nwith its unique ‘cab forward’ design, was the work of\nPeter Stevens, who successfully fended off rivals\nGiorgetto Giugiaro and GM’s Chuck Jordan.\nFrom the start, Stevens’ Elan was controversial. Not\nonly because of its choice of front wheel-drive and the\nbought-in drivetrain, but also for its appearance. Most\nLotus cars were sleek, but this one was different with its\nsharply drooping bonnet, hourglass shape (when viewed\nfrom above) and abruptly terminated hindquarters.\nBut it was an effective shape with a 0.34 Cd figure with\nthe roof up, and a creditable 0.38 with it down.\nRevealed at the 1989 London Motor Fair, it drew\nmuch praise, winning a major award from Britain’s\nDesign Council. Professional road-testers were\nenthusiastic too, with the 1,588cc engine giving the\nturbocharged SE version a top speed in excess of 135mph\nwith a zero-to-sixty sprint taking just 6.7 seconds. And\nthe interior, by Simon Cox, was a masterwork of creative\nparts-bin raiding: plenty of GM switchgear and so on,\nbut neatly camouflaged using red logos and symbols in\nplace of the usual white.\nAt the rear the suspension was pretty conventional, but\nup front a patented ‘active wishbone’ design from Lotus\nengineers Jerry Booen and John Miles (the former Grand\nPrix driver who played a significant role in developing the\ncar’s ride and handling) looked set to mark this car out\nfrom its rivals. Conventional wishbones, mounted as they\nare directly onto the chassis, need to employ soft bushes to\neliminate noise, vibration and harshness. Handling suffers\nas a result, hence Miles and Booen’s decision to mount\ntheir wishbones as stiffly as possible and to do it using\nmetal and rubber bushing rather than just rubber. This\ndone, Lotus believed the car would be able to maintain\nits optimum suspension geometry under the hardest of\ncornering, braking and – doubtless most significantly for\nthe ever growing list of customers placing orders at the\ndealers – acceleration.\nIt worked too, Car magazine calling the resulting\nmachine a real winner. By the time the cars were in\nproduction, pent-up demand ensured a healthy start with\n1,200 Elans in their owners’ garages by the end of 1990.\nA handful of non-turbo versions of the car were in\nfact ordered and sold, but almost all Type 100 Elans were\nproduced as the turbocharged SE model. Eventually,\nwhen a recession-hit GM pulled the plug in 1992, total\nsales of the Type100 were still only just over 3,800 –\nway down on original forecasts.\nList price for the car on the official October 1989 price\nlist issued from the factory was £17,850 for the 130bhp\nnormally aspirated version, and £19,850 for the\nturbocharged SE model, which produced just over\n160bhp. The SE car featured power-steering and 15-inch\nwheels as standard, and because several of the additional\noptions listed (such as Air-Conditioning, leather seats and\ndoor trim) were only available on the SE anyway, the\ndemand for the normally aspirated car was non-existent.\nElan & Elan SE\nType 100\nMODEL\nType 100\nNAME/FORMULA\nElan\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1989\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n129\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus Isuzu 4XE1 14\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1588cc/130bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n148in/68.5/48.5\nWHEELBASE\n88.5in\nWEIGHT\n2198lb/997kg\nMODEL\nType 100\nNAME/FORMULA\nElan SE\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1989-92\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n3167\nENGINE TYPE\nTurbocharged Lotus Isuzu 4XE1-MT\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1588cc/162bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n148in/68.5/48.5\nWHEELBASE\n88.5in\nWEIGHT\n2370lb/1075kg\n162"

With the departure of\nGerard Ducarouge at the close of the previous year, and\nof Honda upon the announcement that Formula One’s\nturbocharged 1,500cc engine specification was to end,\nthe new man in charge was Frank Dernie. Formerly an\naerodynamicist with the Williams team, Dernie now\nfound himself with just a matter of weeks to prepare a\nnew challenger, with a new engine, for the team.\nThis time, after hastily abandoning plans to use an\nintriguing but ultimately disappointing five-valve Tickford\nengine, Team Lotus went to Judd for its engines, choosing\nthe company’s CV 32-valve 90-degree 3,496cc V8. They\ndid so as a mere ‘customer,’ Judd’s main efforts being\ndirected towards supplying its narrower-angle EV V8\nto the March team. Sponsorship for the 1989 effort once\nagain came from Camel and Epson.\nFor his first no-holds-barred Grand Prix design, the\nnew Judd engine enabled Dernie to build a smaller, lighter\ncar than before. So small in fact, that even Peter Warr was\neffusive. “You have to be impressed by the size of this car,”\nhe told journalists. “It is so small that we don’t even have\nto walk around it any more, we can just step over it even\nwhen the driver is on board.” Even so, Dernie had stuck\nby established Lotus principles, albeit with an appreciably\nlonger wheelbase than before and with a waisted section\non the front monocoque which widened to accommodate\nthe cockpit. Significantly, the new car also passed the most\nstringent crash tests, and did so by a wider margin than\nany Team Lotus car had ever done.\nThe car’s intensive test programme in Rio was to be\nshared by Piquet (still suffering from an injury to his ribs\nsustained in a fall on his yacht), Satoru Nakajima and the\nteam’s test driver and former Formula 3000 pilot Martin\nDonnelly. In fact, the latter already had some experience\nof the car, having taken it for a 25-lap private shakedown\naround Snetterton on 2nd March. Clearly impressed, he\nadmitted to having had what he called an “interesting\nexperience... the difference in acceleration between F1\nand F3000 is more than I expected it to be, considering\nthe difference in power. I was also amazed by how tight\nthe cockpit is; some of my suits are looser fitting!” In fact,\nit was so small that the team also had to commission\nMomo to build a specially designed steering wheel for the\ncar, just to prevent Donnelly and the other drivers from\nscraping their knuckles on the sides of the cockpit.\nA week later Piquet expressed delight with the new\ncar: “Once I was driving the car I completely forgot about\nmy painful ribs. I am sure I will be 100 percent fit very\nsoon.” For Dernie, these same shakedown tests provided\na moment for cool reflection. “I am enormously pleased\nwith what we have achieved in the time we have had, (but)\nonly time will tell how successful the car will be. If diligent\nhours spent by the whole team were any measure of\nsuccess, we would win every Grand Prix of the season.”\nBut of course, diligent hours don’t reliably measure\nanything other than time spent, and the early races proved\nit too, with one failure following another. Indeed, not until\nCanada and the sixth round of the championship did\nevents swing round in favour of the Lotus team, with\nPiquet managing a fourth place on the Ile Notre Dame\ntrack and another to follow in Britain. A week later it was\nannounced that two of the old school, Peter Warr and\nFred Bushell, were to leave the team and Tony Rudd\nstepped over from the position of Technical Director\nof Group Lotus and Chairman of Lotus Engineering,\nto become the Executive Chairman of Team Lotus.\nThereafter things got steadily worse for the team, with\na fifth place for Piquet in Germany, sixth in Hungary,\nand at Spa for the Belgian race a near-fiasco with neither\ndriver even managing to qualify. For the fans it was a poor\nyear; for the new car, things could only get better, and it\ndid (if only marginally) with Piquet coming fourth in\nJapan, and Nakajima doing likewise in a rain-soaked\nevent at the season’s finale at Adelaide in Australia.\nWith just 12 points, Piquet wound up a lowly eighth\nin the championship and with the three points scored by\nNakajima added, Team Lotus were a poor sixth in the\nConstructors table with a meagre fifteen points.\nFormula 1\nType 101\n"

Given the short front overhang and\nforward position of the engine this was far more difficult\nthan the team had anticipated. The steering column also\nhad to be changed to accept the air-bag system that was\nobligatory in the US.\nWith larger 16-inch wheels and tyres fitted, the\nsteering set-up required a new approach and gave a quite\na different feel, especially at the lower speeds, necessitated\nby US speed limits. “\nA much tauter response and yet a\nlighter overall feel,” was how Lotus ride and handling\nGuru Roger Becker described it. “The handling is even\nbetter balanced and total grip potential is higher in wet or\ndry conditions.” The widely varied and distinctly different\nroad surfaces in the US played a big part of the equation,\nand tyre development was a big factor in getting the ‘feel’\nof the USA specification Elan just right, and a lot of\nmiles were covered across the US in testing during 1990.\nThe exterior of the car was noticeably different\nfrom the European specification car though. With it’s\nlengthened nose, slightly cleaner rear end with revised\npanel joints and integral wing, and larger wheels with\nsmaller slots that filled the wheel-arches far better, many\npeople felt that the US spec car was more attractive than\nits European counterpart. The interior came with leather\nseats and air-conditioning as standard, and although\nthe two-tone stripe seat and door panel option was not\navailable in the USA, some owners managed to find trim\nsets in the UK and have them retro-fitted. The other\ninterior aspect that unfortunately let the federal car down\nwas the far less elegant ‘air-bag’ steering-wheel fitted to all\nUS-bound Elans. In the UK the wheel carried a central\ngreen and yellow ACBC Lotus badge (which was also the\nhorn push), but in the US the wheel centre simply had\nthe word Lotus de-bossed in the centre and a horn push\nbutton on each of the top two spokes.\nElan SE (Federal)\nType 100\nThenineties\n“The 1970s brought more than just success on the\nracetrack.

        "content": "Though described by Frank Dernie as “to a large extent\nan evolutionary progression on last year’s car,” the Camel\nLotus Type 102 took at least one giant leap forward by\nswitching from Judd V8 power to Lamborghini V12.\nThis engine, mated to a new transverse-located gearbox,\nDernie maintained, “should give us more horsepower\nwith reliability.”\nSlightly longer but narrower than the Judd, the\nLamborghini 80-degree V12 Tipo 3512 engine was\nalso heavier and less fuel efficient. To some extent this\nwould be offset by its greater power output (640bhp at\n13,000rpm) and a revised gearbox using Lamborghini\ngears in a Lotus casing. Clearly, though, the challenge\nfor Dernie and his team would be to accommodate the\nengine in such a way as to optimise the car’s aerodynamic\nefficiency to such a point that the new combination\nwould prove competitive.\nIn a bid to keep the strong points of the Type 101\nand delete the weaker ones, Dernie’s solution was to\nlocate the engine lower in the chassis, nestling neatly\nbeneath the bodywork, and to further improve the\nvehicle’s aerodynamics around the rear wing. With larger\nfuel tanks behind the driver extending across its entire\nwidth, the new car was also somewhat taller than its\npredecessor; it had to be as the team’s new drivers, former\ntest driver Martin Donnelly and, in the number one slot,\nDerek Warwick, were taller than Piquet and Nakajima.\nDespite the longer engine, the Type 102 increased\nin length by only 5cm, largely thanks to the shortening\nof the distance between the engine and the gearbox\noutput. To further offset the weight of the engine, every\ncomponent on the car was scrutinised again to see how\nand where weight could be shaved off.\nThe end result, according to Warwick, was that with\na V12 engine, Lotus and its drivers were “back in League\nOne, racing together with the top teams and we intend to\ncapitalise on it.” His second, the Northern Irish Donnelly,\nwas equally enthusiastic, clearly delighted to be competing\nin Formula 1: “The car looks fantastic and I hope it isn’t\ntoo long before I am pushing Derek hard.” The team’s\ntest driver, Johnny Herbert, was put in reserve.\nLike any other team, Lotus needed the financial\nstability of a faithful sponsor and, once again, it found it\nin R.J. Reynolds with the Camel cigarette brand, keen to\nsupport an all-British driver effort albeit one backed by\nItalian power. While it was the first year for Lotus with\nLamborghini’s V12, it was the engine’s second season in\nGrand Prix racing, something interpreted as good news\nby a team only too aware that the first year for any new\nengine could prove difficult.\nCertainly, the team’s manager Rupert Mainwaring\nremained bullish, telling the press at the car’s launch:\n“Everybody at Team Lotus is well aware of the history\nthat goes with the name Lotus and we’re all determined\nto restore the name to its winning ways. Our plan this\nseason is to score a minimum of 40 championship points,\nand we would like a win. The V12 should be better than\nall the V8s, so that should put us in the front half of the\ngrid immediately. We don’t have any doubt about our\nability to produce a competitive car, and we hope to\nbe always hustling for a position in the top six.”\nBut the first race, at Phoenix, gave warning that things\nmight not turn out as hoped when Martin Donnelly’s car\nsheared a spline-drive to the starter and failed to reach\nthe startline. Warwick had more luck, and arguably drove\nwith more determination and energy, but he too was\nforced out, this time by suspension failure. Through the\nseason Warwick was able to achieve no more than a fifth\nplacing in Hungary and a sixth in Canada. At the Italian\nGrand Prix at Monza, he crashed badly on the second\nlap, losing downforce and sliding wide before being\nlaunched into the air after hitting the guard rail, his car\nlanding on its rollover hoop. The race had to be stopped,\nand incredibly, to the applause of the main grandstand,\nWarwick jogged across the track to the pits and rejoined\nthe second start in the spare car. However in the restarted\nrace he was forced into retirement with clutch trouble\nshortly thereafter.\nMODEL\nType 102\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1990\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n5\nENGINE TYPE\nLamborghini 3512 V12\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3493cc/640bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n175in/84.5in/38.5in\nWHEELBASE\n116in\nWEIGHT\n1102lb/500kg\nTwo races later, Donnelly suffered an horrific career ending crash during qualifying\nfor the Spanish round at Jerez, leaving the relatively inexperienced Johnny Herbert to\ntake his place for the final two races of the year.

        "content": "Magnificent, decidedly brutal and quite different\nfrom anything ever to wear the Lotus badge, when the\nprototype Lotus Carlton – or Lotus Omega if ordered\nwith left-hand-drive – was first seen at the 1989 Geneva\nShow, its proposed specification stunned the motoring\npress and public alike.\nThe car was clearly an attempt to recreate the magic\nand marketing impact of the famous Lotus-Cortina.\nNaturally enough, this time the tie-up was with General\nMotors, the new car being based on the seemingly\ninnocuous, and not especially well-liked, Vauxhall Carlton\nshell. But there was nothing innocuous about the finished\nresult. Wild flared arches, skirts, tremendously wide\nwheels, a deep chin spoiler and numerous other\naerodynamic add-ons gave the car fantastic visual appeal\neven without the plethora of little Lotus badges on both\nbody and engine which served to further underline this\nsuper-sports saloon’s massive potential.\nThis time, unlike the Lotus Cortina and Lotus\nSunbeam, there were no competition objectives for the\nnew car. This was to be a road-car, pure and simple,\na genuine four-door, five-seater, but with the performance\nand handling to rival most supercars and any of the more\nobviously sporting coupés. GM’s Bob Eaton was clear\nabout what his organisation wanted from the Type 104:\nsomething to enable Opel and Vauxhall to shed their\nhumdrum image and to bring a bit of bravado to their\ncars. To do for them, in other words, precisely what the\nCosworth range had done for rival Ford’s Escorts and\nSierras. For the development team at Lotus, the objective\nwas even simpler: to build the world’s fastest saloon.\nTo do this, the company took as its starting point\nthe range-topping 24-valve three-litre Omega, the\nfinished cars being shipped from Opel at Russelheim\nin Germany for a complete strip-down and rebuild\non a new line at Hethel.\nMODEL\nType 104\nNAME/FORMULA\nLotus Carlton/Omega\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1990\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n950\nENGINE TYPE\nGM 6-cylinder 24v\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3615cc/377bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n187.5in/76in/56.5in\nWHEELBASE\n107.5in\nWEIGHT\n3641lb/1652kg\n1990\nLotus Carlton/Omega\nType 104\nBy increasing both the bore and stroke of the existing\nstraight-six, engine capacity was increased to 3.6-litres;\na new cylinder head and twin Garrett AiResearch T25\nblowers and intercoolers taking the unit’s output from\n204bhp and 199lb of torque to a quite staggering\n377bhp at 5,200rpm and 419lb of torque at 4,200rpm.\nTransmission was via a six-speed ZF gearbox (from the\nLotus developed Corvette ZR1), now equipped with\na limited-slip differential.\nThis unprecedented power hike necessitated\nsubstantial modifications to the suspension also, which\naccordingly was uprated with a self-levelling arrangement\nto the rear. Ventilated disc brakes were fitted all round.\nThe interior was uprated too, new seats using Connolly\nhides, and with revised instrumentation.\nWhilst the car’s boot-mounted rear wing was actually\nquite modest for its time, there was no doubting the\nBatmobile-like visual impact of the finished car. The tyre\nand wheel combination said it all: 17x8.5-inch front rims\nwith 235/45ZR17 tyres and still larger ones at the back,\n9.5-inch rims with 265/40ZR17 rubber. This was a very\nserious machine indeed and the company was proud of\nits claim that the Carlton’s revised aerodynamics gave it\nan enhanced 0.31 Cd while ensuring that it remained\nstable throughout its very considerable speed range.\nHow considerable? General Motors admitted to\nrecording 176mph on a closed circuit in Italy with a\n0-62mph time of 5.4 seconds. On the road, the car\nachieved “over 174mph” with one UK-based motoring\nmagazine recording, for the first time in its long history,\nin-gear acceleration figures for 140-160mph.\nThough launched at Geneva in 1989, it was, to be\na year before the company actually started shipping\ncars. By that time many journalists had switched from\ncriticising the car as “merely a Vauxhall” to praising\nit as the magnificent well-sorted beast it was, and despite\na reasonable entry price of £48,000, by the time\nproduction ceased in 1992 the original sales target of\nsome 1,100 had not been reached. Vauxhall records\nshowed 440 completed Carltons, and Opel just over 500\nOmegas, for a grand total of 950 including prototypes.\n166"

Their development time was\nextremely short – a matter of weeks – although the team\nwas able to use a lot of expertise and materials from\nexisting programmes.\nBesides the ditching of many unnecessary ancillaries,\nthe use of polycarbonate windows and (where possible)\nlightweight panels, to bring the car down to a dry weight\nof 2,400lb, the biggest visible changes were the relocation\nof the rear wing and an extended front spoiler. The\nchassis was left ungalvanised (saving a further 17.6lb)\nand the car was equipped with an FIA-approved roll cage,\nfitted to the suspension towers at each corner to improve\nchassis stiffness. Revised suspension geometries altered\nthe caster and dive characteristics and the ride-height\nwas reduced by some 10mm.\nWhile based on the two left-hand-drive racing cars, the 20 cars (which had been\nneeded to be built ensure Homologation for racing) naturally gained an improved\nspecification including air conditioning on all but one of the 20, an interior re-trimmed\nwith charcoal doeskin fabric, new Lotus sports seats, three-point seatbelts, and an RAC\napproved club roll cage. Features stripped out to save weight in the race cars – including\nglass windows, a heater and the chassis galvanisation – were restored for the road cars.\nDevelopment was once again left to John Miles and Roger Becker, the end result being\na car no less than two seconds per lap quicker than the standard production model, the\n264bhp 16-valve turbo four giving a zero to 60mph time of just 4.7 seconds with a top\nspeed in excess of 160mph.\nEsprit SE (SCCA)\nType 105\nThe uprated brakes came from the Lotus Carlton,\nemploying 13-inch discs at the front, 11-inch at the rear,\nwith 4-piston alloy AP calipers. The wheels were new too:\nRevolution three-piece racing alloys (15-inch front and\n16-inch rear) with Goodyear Eagle ZR tyres (225/45s\nfront and 255/50s rear). Competition Monroe shock\nabsorbers were fitted, and later an electronic Lotus-GM\nABS braking system.\nThe blueprinted engine used Lotus Carlton injectors\nand as a test one of the two racecars built even had the\nair-conditioning radiator cleverly re-deployed by being\nplumbed into the chargecooler system. With a\nreprogrammed engine management system, the motor\nwas capable of developing something between 285\nand 300bhp driving through a blue printed Renault\ntransmission unit.\nDriven by Doc Bundy and Scott Lagasse, the results\nwere impressive, with four victories in eight races,\nincluding two 1-2 finishes, six pole positions and a total\nof 2,900 miles with no major mechanical breakdowns.\nFurthermore, the Type 105s set the fastest single lap in six\nout of the eight SCCA events and led seven of the eight\nraces, finishing second overall to the rival Corvettes.\nIt was perhaps inevitable that the factory would seek\nto capitalise on this success and, in September 1990,\nAutoweek magazine in the US announced the launch\nfor sale of a limited series of 20 “street legal race\ncars.” Lotus claimed not to like the term\n“street legal”, for its X180-R, but admitted\nit would be offering “the exclusivity of\nthe Lotus Esprit Turbo SE to a handful\nof individuals who wished to enjoy\na car on the street that can be\ncompetitive at track events.”\n"

Driver’s seats were now\nfilled by Julian Bailey and motorsport’s latest ‘Flying Finn’ Mika Hakkinen, and, for the\ntime being, Johnny Herbert remained as the team’s test driver.\nPrior to the takeover, Dernie had been working on a mock-up of a new Type 103 car\nwith a high front nose. However, with minimal sponsorship and many other constraints,\nit was decided to continue with a re-worked version of the previous year’s car. This new\nType 102B was outwardly very similar to the Lamborghini-powered car which had been\nraced by the team in 1990. It had, however, been substantially modified – some 800 new\nparts suggesting that no less than 90% of the car had come under close scrutiny.\nAs its Judd engines perhaps indicated, the 102B was to be in the words of Collins,\n“only the start. We have also established a new programme of research and development\nthat will enable Team Lotus to realise its full potential and become race winners again.”\nInevitably, many of the modifications were made in order that the existing chassis\ncould be made to accept the V8 Judd in place of the long and narrow Italian V12.\nTo comply with the new 1991 FISA safety and crash regulations, a new monocoque\nwas constructed using the latest composite materials, in particular a mixture of high\nmodulus and high strength unidirectional carbon-fibre. While the rear bulkhead was\nrevised completely to accept the Judd EV engine, a new bell housing, oil tank and\nsix-speed transverse gearbox (designed by Team Lotus and still using Lamborghini\ninternals) were put in place to provide the car’s final drive.\nAs a result of these and other modifications, the car achieved clear passes in all\nthe 1991 FISA crash tests, including the newly introduced barrier-crash test which\nwas conducted to meet the even more stringent 1992 requirements. A 24-channel data\nacquisition system was also installed, built for the team at Britain’s Cranfield Institute\nof Technology and designed to record chassis and engine parameters as well as to\ncontrol the driver’s instruments and information displays.\nExtensive revisions meant that the Type 102B gained\na completely new nose, body-top, undertray and wings.\nThe wind tunnel was also used to redesign the oil and\nwater cooling systems to ensure their respective functions\nwere optimised for the new engine.\nSuspension geometry was new also, with both the front\nand rear ends stiffened substantially. New front and rear\ndampers were designed jointly by the team and\nOMZ; all-carbon brakes were supplied by AP\nand actuated using Brembo calipers.\nAfter initial problems qualifying, the team\nhit the points chart with Hakkinen and Bailey\nmanaging to come in fifth and sixth at Imola for\nthe San Marino race. For the next six races,\nhowever, neither car managed to finish until,\nHerbert, replacing Bailey, came seventh in Canada.\nThereafter, with other racing commitments\npreventing him from racing in Germany, Hungary,\nItaly and Spain, Herbert’s place was taken by\nGerman driver Michael Bartels who failed to qualify\nfor all four races.\nIn a bid to get the car competitive, the team\nexperimented with its much-vaunted ‘active’ suspension\nthroughout winter testing. An Isuzu V12-engined car\n(the 102C) was also built and evaluated at this time,\nalong with a Cosworth-built Ford-engined derivative\n(Type 102D) fitted with the HB V8 engine used by\nBenetton at the end of 1991.\nIt was this Type 102D version that would serve the\nteam for the first four races of the 1992 season, even\nscoring a point each for both Herbert and Hakkinen\nin the South African and Mexican GPs respectively.\nFormula 1\nType 102B\n168"

        "content": "In 1993 the LotuSport run Type 106 Esprit racecar\nteam faced one of problems that has dogged Lotus over\nthe years, namely being too successful. After the first two\nraces of the season, both won by Lotus, one each for Doc\nBundy and David Murry, IMSA (the ruling body) decided\nto change the championship rules to clearly favour the\nPorsches. By offering a bonus five championship points\nfor pole position and two points for second on the grid, it\nwould be almost impossible for a Lotus to win the series\nagain. The Porsche cars held an advantage of almost\n100bhp over the Esprits and they would always be able\nto take pole position, and the additional points available\nin practice. In the race, though, the better handling and\nmore nimble Esprits were usually able to overcome\nthis power advantage to win over the Porsches, but\nnonetheless the points advantage gained in\npractice was always going to be too great\nfor the Lotus team cars to overcome.\nIn a further attempt to slow the\nEsprit and to add insult to injury,\nIMSA next changed the rules\non turbocharger outputs. This\nfurther restricted the Type\n106’s performance and\nwith the German Porsches\nnow having an advantage\nof almost 200bhp, the\nchase for championship\nhonours was well and truly\nover for the 1993 season.\nFor the 1991 season the Pure Sports team built three\nmore Esprit race cars, again based on the EC LHD\nvariant. Developed to comply with the revised SCCA\nWorld Challenge race regulations for 1991 they were\nraced by LotuSport Inc., the driver line up still headed\nby Doc Bundy.\nPrincipal modifications for the new cars – now dubbed\nthe Type 106 – included a strengthened chassis with a\nredesigned and more complex FIA roll cage, increased\nsuspension geometry adjustment and the front bib spoiler\nfrom the X180-R, as well as the adoption of 17-inch\ndiameter wheels on the rear. The two Type 105 chassis\nfrom the previous year were also converted to Type 106\nspec using parts (including a chassis) supplied by\nLotus in the UK.\nLotus Engineering in the UK began to realise the\npotential for marketing the Esprit using this success, and\nin 1992 launched a division of the company based at\nthe factory in Norfolk, called LotuSport Performance\nProducts. This new division was as their Press Release\nstated “now able, via LotuSport Performance Parts, to\noffer the benefits of its experience in the design, build,\npreparation and racing of Esprits to wider markets,\ni.e., private race teams and individuals.”\nTheir three primary selling points were thus:\n1) Esprit Racecar build and preparation, with each project\ndesigned and built to customer requirements within\nspecified race regulations, vehicles prepared, tested and\ntuned at Hethel, delivered ‘key ready’. 2) Esprit race\ncomponents, with most of the special components\ndesigned for racecar build available and sold separately\nto customers. 3) Esprit performance products for road\nuse, with some of the components designed for use in\npoints 1 and 2, also being available to elevate the\nperformance of regular road-going Esprit models.\nThe Type 106 would continue to be successful in both\n1992 and 1993, with Bundy winning the drivers title in\n1992. Lotus Cars in the UK were rightfully proud of the\nachievements of the Esprit racecars in the USA and, at\na time when the Formula 1 team were struggling to be\ncompetitive used every opportunity to blow the trumpet\nfor Lotus Engineering and LotuSport.\nIn a promotional leaflet entitled ‘Continuing the\nLotus heritage’ LotuSport stated their case. “Under Colin\nChapman, Lotus first made its name in international\nsportscar racing against the world’s best.” “Since 1990\nLotus Esprits in the USA have been taking on the best\nfrom Corvette, Porsche, Mazda, Mitsubishi, etc, in the\nprestigious SCCA and IMSA sportscar GT series,\ncollecting 11 victories and the 1992 IMSA drivers’\nchampionship with Doc Bundy.

        "content": "Murphy and his team had originally intended to use a\nJudd V10 engine for this new car until negotiations with\nBritain’s Vickers PLC opened up the possibility of Team\nLotus co-operating with its subsidiary Cosworth. Most\nsignificantly, this change of direction marked a renewal\nof the alliance between the Lotus Formula 1 team\nand the Ford brand-name, evoking memories of the\npartnership’s historic debut victory at Zandvoort in 1967.\nThat victory by Jim Clark was the first of 155 for the\nfamous DFV (Double-Four-Valve) engine and its\nderivatives, and with its new engine, the HB Series V –\nat the time the fastest revving V8 in history – Ford hoped\nto repeat the magic. With at least 730bhp available at a\ncrank speed in the region of 13,500rpm, Lotus and its\nnew main sponsor Castrol (who signed up in time for the\nBritish Grand Prix) must have hoped so too. The venture\nwas not, journalists were told, merely “an exercise in\nnostalgia,” but a genuine bid for victory.\nThe engine itself, a 75-degree vee of 3,494cc used an\naluminium crankcase and cylinder heads, manufactured\nin Cosworth’s Worcester foundry. Other componentry\nwas of carbon composite, titanium and magnesium; it\nwas therefore a sophisticated ensemble, certainly more\nexpensive than the previous year’s Judd V10 package, but\nhopefully worth it. And once the deal was struck, Murphy\nseemed extremely happy with the new engine, admitting it\nallowed him to, “get the weight exactly where we wanted\nit.” Power was transmitted to the wheels via a six-speed\ntransverse mounted gearbox, in another Team Lotus-\ndesigned casing, this time though housing X-trac\nsourced internals.\nIn true Chapman style, simplicity and lightness were\nMurphy’s twin objectives throughout the project, and the\nfinished car came very close to the minimum weight limit\nthen in force. His pursuit of state-of-the-art aerodynamics\n– developed in the team’s own wind-tunnel –\nconcentrated on the car’s front end, particularly around\nthe nose wings. The monocoque was another carbon\nfibre-skinned aluminium honeycomb sandwich; the\nbodywork and nosebox assembly an energy-absorbing\ncarbon structure (as per FISA requirements) comprising\na one-piece composite engine cover, separate sidepods\nand a flat underbody with a complex rear diffuser section.\nInitially at least (during its debut with a single chassis at\nImola), the car ran with conventional passive suspension;\nthereafter the plan was to use a conventional coil-spring/\ndamper suspension set-up at each corner but operated in\nconjunction with an evolution of the company’s ‘active’\nsuspension, which it called Lotus Suspension Dynamics.\nFar simpler than the system employed by the team from\n1983 to ’87, it was described by Peter Collins at the launch\nas “controlled reactive.”\nThis switchable system certainly appealed to the\nteam’s drivers, Hakkinen and Herbert. The latter, having\nalready experienced three different Lotuses (and a\nBenetton) described the cars good points as follows: “The\naerodynamics, particularly on high-speed circuits, and its\nmechanical grip. The drag doesn’t seem to be fantastically\nhigh, so it feels quick on the straights too.

Overall weight on the S4\n(already in development at the time of the Sport\n300 launch) was measurably heavier (270lb), even\nif only because a standard Sport 300 would not\nusually have air conditioning (a £1495 option on\nthe Sport 300), nor would a Sport feature audio\nequipment, digital clock, tunnel top console and\nmap pockets, or under carpet sound deadening.\nMost press pictures saw the Sport 300 depicted in\na searing yellow, Lotus Sport Yellow Pearl, which\nwas an equally eye-watering £1,995 option.\nFor the first time wheel-arch extensions were\nspecified on a showroom Esprit. The factory-fit\nwheels and tyres were 5-spoke Oz items of three-\npiece construction, the 16-inch diameter, 8.5-inch\nwidth fronts covered by Goodyear GS-C 245/45s.\nAt the back, the huge 17x10.5-inch wheels were\nfeatured under a 315/35 GS-C cover.\nAs the most expensive 4-cylinder Esprit of all\n(£64,995 at the October 1992 introduction), the\nEsprit Sport 300 had to deliver a promised\n162mph, 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds and romp\n0-100mph in just eleven seconds.\nThe key ingredients of the Sport 300 were the\noriginal S3 body base [selected for lowest-weight]\nand its progression into the X180R.

The cylinder-head featured enlarged and ported intake tracts with\nlarger inlet valves, a unique hybrid Garrett T3/4 turbocharger boosting\naround 1 bar momentarily and 0.9 bar continuously, the GM-Lotus ECU\nrecalibrated to accentuate full boost power, which increased 36bhp over\nits contemporary, the S4.\nThe official 2.2-litre Sport result was the production of 302bhp at\n6400rpm, which represented 139bhp a litre. That was a high production\noutput for 1992-1993 – Ford Cosworth 2-litres yielded 204 to 220bhp in\nthis era – but Lotus had not forgotten mid-range torque in this giddy\nhigh-yield environment.\n"

However, with the ban removed in\n1991, Lotus entered into discussions with the independent\ninventor of the concept and, by February 1992, had\nconfirmed its potential with a series of wind tunnel tests\nconducted at MIRA, by Lotus aerodynamicist Richard\nHill (right).

Work progressed rapidly, with the first\nwind tunnel tests of the new monocoque being completed\nin March of that year. By mid-June the factory was ready\nfor the first test rides of the prototype Lotus Sport\ntime-trial bicycle, to be designated Type 110.\nThereafter, it was back into the wind tunnel to confirm\nthese performance improvements, the end result being a\nsophisticated all-composite monocoque with an aerofoil\ncross section, formed using unidirectional and balanced-\nweave carbon-fibre plies in an epoxy resin. Whilst\nBoardman’s pursuit bike had used mono-blade wheel\nlocation at the front, the new bike used a twin-blade\nwheel mounting but still with aerofoil cross-sections and\nconstructed using a method identical to that employed\nfor the main monocoque. The rear mounting featured\n‘wishbone’-shaped rear chainstays, integral with the\nmonocoque with the wheel set into the rear of the\nmonocoque for minimum drag.\nThe bike competed for the first time in July 1993\non the Prologue of the Tour de France and was\nridden by Erik Breukink of the Spanish ONCE team.\nIt was equipped at the factory with a full set of Mavic\ncomponents, thereby continuing the close co-operation\nbetween the two companies which had worked together\non Boardman’s Type 108 Olympic bike.\nTime-Trial Bike\nType 110\nalteration though was to attach the smaller\nrear wing directly to the tailgate. The inside\nstyling story was every bit as detailed as the\nwork outside and covered just about every\nvisible bare and trimmed panel. The Connolly\nleather seats with lumbar supports were\nremodelled and full-leather trim was featured\non the inside of the doors, along with inset\ncomposite finish panels and graphite race\ncar appearance for the entry kick plates.\nThe instrument binnacle was revamped\nagain but the black and white instruments\nand a three spoke steering wheel survived.\nOther detail styling modifications\ncomprised a subtle reshaping of the bonnet,\nrevised exhaust pipe tips, and a roof mounted\nradio aerial. Showing pride in their work, the\ndesign team added distinctive ‘Esprit S4’\nlogos on the side rear glass.\nLotus only planned to make something\napproaching 300 of the S4 annually and it\nfinished production in 1996 with a total of\n624 manufactured, an average of just over\n156 a year. The 1994-97 S4S overlapped and\ndelivered 367 examples, whilst the rare Sport\n300 contributed just 64 ever more specialised\nEsprits. It was getting harder and harder\nevery sales season, and Lotus redoubled their\nefforts to bring a V8 powered Esprit to market.\nFor the 1994 Tour, Chris Boardman’s record-breaking performance on the Prologue\ngave him the prized leader’s Yellow Jersey, making him the first ever Briton to lead the\nrace for two successive days. Unfortunately, due to injury he was forced to retire from the\nevent, but went on to win two gold medals at that year’s Cycling World Championships\nin Sicily, with France’s Moreau taking silver, thus securing a unique 1-2 for the Type 110\nat the championships.\nDesigned to accept a variety of group-sets of wheels, gears and brakes, the unique\nLotus Sport Type 110 was also offered for sale, priced at £1,650 plus taxes for the frame\nand forks only.\n"

The Series 2 did\nhowever retain the Type 100 designation. The list price\nfor the car which now only available in turbocharged\nform, was up to £24,500 (for the European market only).\nWith the enforced addition of a Catalytic converter,\nengine power however, was down by 10bhp to 155, the\nsame figure as the Catalyst equipped federal specification\ncar and with the inevitable increase in overall weight the\n0–60mph acceleration time increased.\nEngineers at Lotus also took the opportunity to make\nrevisions to the suspension/damper/steering set-up, which\nsome had felt was over-assisted. Stiffer bushings were used\nin the rafts to give a firmer ride and the power steering\nwas re-valved to give improved feel. The rear suspension\ntop link was also re-designed to reduce cost and the\nantilock brakes were re-calibrated.\nThe UK edition of CAR Magazine on driving the\nS2 said, “The Elan has never been about pure muscle; it’s\nabout balance, precision and sheer dynamic ability and\nthe S2 has these qualities in abundance.

The old\nbugbear of road noise tyre rumble reared its head on both\nSport 300 and S4S.\nMotor Sport magazine commented of their mid-\nnineties S4S demonstrator, “Lotus treads a desperately\nfine line in making the S4S almost a halfway house.\nThe S4S may have a suspension set up closer to the\nstandard car than the racer, but it wears the fatter, less\ncompromising rubber.” This veteran monthly magazine\nalso complained about another annoyance that many\n1980s mass production saloons suffered from, vibrations\nand rattles from the glass sunroof.\nMotor Sport went on to summarise a winter week in\nwet and occasionally snowy conditions, the staff writer\nspeculating, “I’ll stick my neck out and profess the Esprit\nS4S to be the best Esprit yet. In fact I’ll go one further,\nfor which I may well be hung drawn and quartered.\nI think the Lotus Esprit S4S is, for the moment, the most\ncomplete British sports car – period.” Thus concluded\nthe anonymous contributor’s comparison of their press\nfleet Esprit (registered N584 GEX) against all the British\nopposition as well as a then £90,000 Ferrari option.\nIf the S4S impressed a cross section of owners,\nLotus executives and testers, unfortunately the sales\nfigures told a different story: Lotus desperately needed\nthe proposed V8 model, if only to reignite public interest\nin the aging Esprit.

The cars had been developed along the same route\nas the Types 105 and 106 for the USA series, and their\nhighly competitive performances prompted Group Lotus\nto become more seriously involved.\nBy 1995, classified as the official works team, the\nLotus Esprit GT team entered the Karcher Global\nEndurance GT Series four-hour race at Donington with\na new-look racing car, but still designated Type 82, which\nhad been developed during the closed season. It was, as\nsuch, the first Lotus works-entry in a sports car category\nsince 1969, marking the next step in the company’s\ndeclared strategy to return to its former pre-eminent\nposition in international motorsport arena.\nQualifying to run in the immensely competitive\nGT2 category, the car was driven by a partnership of\nex- Formula 1 driver Alessandro Zanardi (formerly with\nTeam Lotus where he had driven the Type 107B and 109)\n1995\nEsprit GT2 Racecar\nType 82\ntheir class rivals – and successfully setting the fastest GT2 lap of the race. But just eight\nminutes from the finish of the four-hour race, a horrified Alessandro Zanardi coasted to\na halt as the car’s Hewland gearbox suddenly and dramatically failed, dashing completely\nthe team’s hope of a truly historic maiden victory for the Esprit.\nBy the time the car was readied for its second outing, in torrential September\nrain at Silverstone for the Norwich Union Empire Trophy, the chassis and upper body\naerodynamics had undergone considerable development at the hands of George\nHoward-Chappell and technical manager Ian Foley, helping the duo to score\na superb class win (and to be placed fourth overall).\nand British Touring Car Championship privateer Alex\nPortman. Sponsorship came initially from the UK Lotus\ndealer network, with additional funding coming in later\nfrom Norwich Union, Haymarket Publishing via\nAutocar magazine and the Mercantile\nlogistics company.\nThis substantially new GT racer, based\naround a near 400bhp version of the race-\nwinning 2.2-litre Esprit Sport 300 engine,\nfeatured Formula 1-style aerodynamics giving\nalmost 30 percent greater downforce than the\nearlier car with new fuel, cooling and electrical\nsystems. The clutch was a competition Tilton\nfour-plate unit with a five-speed Hewland DG300\ngearbox and the car used AP Racing calipers and discs.\nThe OZ 18-inch magnesium wheels (nine inches wide\nat the front, eleven at the rear) were fitted with Michelin\nPilot SX, slicks or wets. A full Formula 1 data-acquisition\nsystem was also installed and the Esprit, lighter than ever\nbefore and running very near the 900kg minimum weight.\nCompetition at Donington was particularly stiff and\nincluded six McLaren, Porsche and Ferrari entries. Just\neight laps of the first qualifying session were enough,\nhowever, for the Esprit to prove its mettle by securing the\nprovisional class pole position. Zanardi further stunned\nthe other teams by putting his car seventh on the grid,\ntwo seconds ahead of his nearest GT2 rival and effectively\nsplitting the more powerful GT1 grouping in the bargain.\nIn the event itself, however, the car’s competition\ndebut provided a mixture of elation and disappointment\nfor the team with the two drivers battling through the field\nto a comfortable fourth position overall – trapped behind\na trio of dominant McLaren F1s but a clear lap ahead of\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nGT2 Racecar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1995\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n3\nENGINE TYPE\nLotus 910S turbocharged & intercooled\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2174cc/380bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n170in/77in/43.5in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n1990lb/903kg"

The\nElise was just coming on stream, but they saw\nan opportunity to introduce an Esprit that was\ncheaper and less powerful, but more agile.\n1996\nEsprit GT3\nType 82\nThe budget price four cylinder harked back to the origins\nof the Esprit, relying on the 2-litre capacity that had\nserved export markets like Italy, but considerably updated\nwith electronically managed fuel injection and a specific\nGarrett TB03 turbocharger with water cooling. The\ncompression was set at the old Turbo Esprit figure of\n8:1. Boost was indicated consistently as 0.75 bar/10.7psi\nbut in cold weather more power was attainable and the\nchargecooler unit could deliver a 20bhp bonus.\nThe official statistics revealed 240bhp at 6250rpm as\nthe peak power, along with 216lbft of torque by 3750rpm,\nall achieved on 95 octane unleaded. Official Lotus figures\nclaimed 0-60mph in 5.1 seconds and 0-100mph in 12.5\nseconds, but Autocar magazine returned 0-60mph in 4.8\nseconds and 0-100 in the claimed Lotus figure of 12.5\nseconds, going on to return a 0-140mph time of 30.1\nseconds. In the minds of many people, the GT3 quickly\nestablished itself as one of the best ever Esprit models.\nThere were some penalties to pay with 2-litres, top\ngear acceleration amongst them. The lower torque figure\nmeant that 50-70mph times in 5th gear drooped, slipping\njust above 8 seconds versus the 6.3 seconds for the 1989\nEsprit Turbo SE 2.2-litre in the flexibility appraisal. One\nmagazine commented: “There is grip, finesse and balance\nfrom the still superb chassis.” The same source felt that,\n“all the serious action is above 4000rpm, and you need to\nbe in the right gear at the right time.” The upside of the\n2-litre should have been fuel consumption, (naturally it\nlooked good against the then new V8) but figures weren’t\nas good as could have been expected, varying from 19.9\nto 24.7mpg in independent assessments gained from\nhard going to brisk touring outside urban areas.\nThe engine designation was recoded from the 910\nof the 1989 onward turbo SE breed to 920, but the\nproduction Esprit Type number of 82 remained –\nas it had since the 1980 Esprit Turbo and in fact would\nremain throughout the V8s. Under 200 GT3s were\nmade in its sub-three year run from the close of 1996,\nbut the 4-cylinder was nevertheless strategically important\nto preserving the longevity of the Esprit nameplate, as\nit sold for just under £40,000, a little over £20,000 less\nthan the Esprit V8 demanded at its introduction.\nKey to GT3 character was the lower kerb weight,\nwhich was right in the Sport 300 league at a quoted\n1240kg/2728lb, and the way that was achieved was\nthrough a fundamental shift back to basics. That approach\nwas most evident in the cabin, which reverted to fixed\nback seats covered with matt-black leather-look vinyl\nand dispatched air conditioning to the options list along\nwith such basics as an audio system. Even airbags were\nlisted as an option, as was an alarm system. The centre\nconsole was simplified by deleting the storage bins and\nbody coded paint colour was added to the backs of the\nseats and the centre console to give the interior a modern\nand sporty look. The minimalist interior found plenty\nof fans, though.\nThe minimalist approach also showed on the exterior,\nwith the deletion of the rear wing, which created an\nattractive clean look option, something that had been\nmissing from the Esprit range over the past few years.\nThe wheel and tyre allocation was generous and very\nearly Press cars were fitted with 17-inch diameter, split-\nrim, 5-spoke alloys (7-inch front and 8.5-inch rear) of\nLotus design manufactured by OZ that had been seen on\nthe S4S. Later production cars run adopted the 5-spoke\nLotus rims (see above) that had appeared on the S4, all\nbearing Goodyear Eagle GS-A asymmetric covers of\n215/40ZR spec at the front and 245/45ZR on the back.\nWhere the S4S had a mixture of Brembo (rear) and\nAP Racing components, the GT3 relied on Brembo\nsupplies for discs and calipers backed by a power-assisted\nDelco Moraine three channel ABS system. The Lotus\ncolour chart for the GT3 showed three colours Chrome\nOrange, Electric Green and Saturn Silver but it seems very\nfew were produced in anything but orange.\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit GT3\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1996-99\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n196\nENGINE TYPE\nTurbocharged Lotus 920S\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1998cc/240bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n172in/73.5in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n95in\nWEIGHT\n2728lb/1237kg\n180"

Porsche, McLaren and Mercedes would rule\nthe roost with unfeasibly huge budgets/resources but\nLotus created a mean flyweight machine with 500-560\nair-restricted horsepower. The Esprit GT1 was stripped\nout to the 900kg of a 4-cylinder GT2 and fitted with\n6-speed transmission, F1-style aerodynamics and carbon\nbrakes. Despite this impressive technical specification,\nit rarely finished events in the demanding BPR Global\nSportscar Championship series.\nLotus created their GT1 Esprit at the emotive and\nvacant Ketteringham Hall, former Formula 1 home of\nTeam Lotus that had folded in late 1994. This was\nsomething of a homecoming for the two guiding lights\nof the GT squad, team Lotus veterans George Howard-\nChappell and Ian Foley.\nHoward-Chappell reported that he had been somewhat\ninstrumental in establishing Lotus presence in GT1 racing\nwith the Esprit. He told Autosport in 1996: “as early as\nMay 1994 we were talking to Lotus directors about GT\nracing. The F1 team was not as successful as it should\nhave been, so it was a logical move to go into sports car\nracing. We were offering our services to do the job\nrequired; the closure of the F1 team merely provided\nthe final catalyst.”\nFollowing the racing success of Esprit in America,\nthe Lotus directors were receptive and authorization\nwas granted. This was no production conversion, but\na ground-up racer with a carbon-fibre shell and integral\n[Lotus] roll cage, the backbone chassis heavily reinforced\nand triangulated for its fiercest challenge.\nThe motor remained at the production 3.5-litres – it\nhas the meat to go out to 4-litres but the regulations would\nnot have favoured this displacement – and Alan Nobbs\nreported, “It was a dry sump job with one large T04\nGarrett turbo instead of the twin-turbos of the street car.\nIt had a steel crankshaft machined from a solid billet,\nthe rods came from Pankl and the pistons originated at\nCosworth. It ran at its first race with an old hybrid T03/4\nturbo and 450 horsepower, but was solid at 500bhp\nfor the second outing with the larger Garrett.”\nThe 1996 Esprit squad consisted of two regular\nentries, with the leading car piloted by Jan Lammers and\nPerry McCarthy. Things came good for the pairing in\nthe fourth round at Silverstone where they qualified third\nfastest and finished on the same lap as the inevitable\nwinning BMW V12-powered McLaren F1.\nUnfortunately this would be the best result of the year,\nalthough the Lammers Esprit was also dauntingly fast at\nJarama, Spain for the third round of the Global series.\nHere Lammers qualified just 0.5sec from pole and led the\nopening laps of the race, only to tumble down the order\nas its Michelins faded. In a year in which the lightweight\nLotus was an inconsistent performer, some final promise\nat Jarama was snuffed out by a driveshaft failure, where\nthe unfortunate McCarthy got just one lap!\nThe second 1996 Esprit GT1 was assigned to the\nDutch Racing Promotions, their finance fielding Mike\nHezemans, partnered regularly by money man Alex\nMODEL\nType 114\nNAME/FORMULA\nGT1 Racecar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1996\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n3\nENGINE TYPE/SIZE\nLotus 918, 32-valve V8 turbocharged & intercooled\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3506cc/400bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n170in/77in/43in\nWHEELBASE\n96in\nWEIGHT\n1990lb/903kg\nEsprit GT1 Racecar\nType 114\nPortman.

The project team was\ngiven just 27 months to create, design and build a\nunique power unit for a world-beating new supercar.\nSo a cleansheet approach was adopted under the wing\nof former Ford engineer John Owen and Hugh Kemp,\nthen director of powertrains at Lotus Engineering.\nIn March 1996 an all-new Esprit GT1 racer was\nunveiled at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, the still-\nsecret Lotus V8 lurking under its engine cover. Four days\nlater the secret was out, when the long-awaited 175mph\nEsprit V8 road car finally made its debut at the\nGeneva Motor Show.\nCoded 918 in all its production formats and rated at\nthe same maximum power and torque figures throughout\nits 1996-2003 production life, the Lotus eight was suitably\nhigh tech as the first new company production engine\nsince the 907 of 1972. It sported 32-valves, four overhead\ncamshafts and twin turbochargers. Extreme power was\nnot on the menu, 350bhp was the most frequently quoted,\nbut 550bhp was possible from the single turbo race unit\ndeveloped for the racing Esprit GT1. The biggest gain\nwas anticipated from the torque figure, but at 295lbft\nbeyond 4000rpm, it – like the horsepower – was more\nin an unrelenting linear surge.\nMeeting all the global environmental and safety\nhomologation criteria for the year 2000, with the 350bhp\navailable at 6,500rpm and with the potential to hit low\nzero-to-sixty times, this all-new Lotus-designed 3.5-litre\nV8, sporting distinctive red crackle-finish cam covers,\nwould be the engine to take the phenomenal Esprit into\nthe new millennium.\nPerformance from the unit – now equipped with\ntwo Allied Signal T25 water-cooled turbochargers – was\nimpressive to say the least, with an independently verified\ntop speed of 175mph, a 0-60mph sprint time of just\n4.8 seconds and with 0-100mph taking barely more\nthan ten seconds.\nTradition was not followed in the engine management\nelectronics, for Lotus went to EFI Technology in Bologna,\nItaly, rather than their former owners at GM and Delco.\nLotus worked with Bugatti and found a lot of common\nground they could utilize from a Bugatti V12 motor\nprogramme, and delivered on the software and utilized\none primary injector per cylinder, a secondary injection\nfeed on each bank and ignition coils triggered from\na crankshaft position sensor.\nThe introduction in 1998 of a new, specially-\ndeveloped AP Racing twin-plate low-inertia clutch did\nmuch to improve the powerful new car’s driveability (using\na range of lightweight components to reduce pedal effort),\nwhile a re-engineered gearbox selector mechanism gave\nit even greater shift precision.\nBraking performance was impressive, the new\nlightweight Kelsey-Hayes ABS braking system being\nemployed to increase vehicle stability under heavy braking\nwhile maintaining a progressive feel. Complementing the\nKelsey-Hayes ABS were 296mm front and 300mm rear\ndiscs from Brembo in Italy, who also supplied the calipers\nthat clamped down on the ventilated discs.\nAerodynamically minor changes were made including\ndistinctive small winglets ahead of the front wheels, and\na larger air intake incorporated in the Esprit’s under\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit V8\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1996-2003\nEXAMPLES BUILT\napprox. 550\nENGINE TYPE\nTwin Turbo Lotus 918, 32-valve V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3506cc/350bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173.5in/74in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n95in\nWEIGHT\n3040lb/1379kg\nbumper cooling/aerodynamic contours, which also served a brace of oil-coolers.\nExternal decoration was minimal, comprising the main V8 logo beside the rear number\nplate and Esprit V8 decals on both rear side windows. There were also separate chrome\ntipped tailpipes on either side of the reversed aerofoil blade in matt black beneath the\nrear bumper. Other car spotter tip-offs included 6-spoke cast alloy AWI wheels of\n8.5x17-inch and 10x18-inch carrying 235/40ZR and 285/35ZR rubber from Michelin\nPilot SXMXX3. Some of the early V8 cars from 1996 did however carry 5-spoke OZ\nsplit-rim wheels with the same wheel and tyre specifications.\nAn updated facia with a new smaller binnacle and a narrow centre tunnel\nmaximised the car’s interior space, while an all-new instrument layout and revised\ncontrols improved the car’s ergonomics. Instruments were wisely kept to an absolute\nminimum with just four highly legible VDO dials: the speedo incorporating an LCD\nodometer and trip, a digital rev-counter, and twin fuel and temperature gauges laid\nout for maximum clarity. A pair of superb sports seats with hand-finished leather\ntrim completed the cabin upgrades in style.\nStunning performance, no-compromise appointments, and the unquestionable\nrace-bred heritage of a marque of distinction, had combined once again to make\nthe Esprit V8 a driver’s car like no other.\nMilestone Car\n"

The Elise was quickly heralded as a new\nbreed of supercar – small, high-tech and simple,\noffering brilliant performance and handling for\nthe enthusiastic driver, the hallmarks of many\nclassic Lotus designs.\nNamed after the grand-daughter of the\nflamboyant Italian head of Bugatti Industries\nand Group Lotus chairman Romano Artioli, the\nall-new car featured a futuristic, yet practical\nand proven epoxy-bonded aluminium\nspaceframe chassis, clothed in a compact and\nhighly distinctive body designed by a team\nheaded up by Julian Thomson.\nThe new Type 111 was intended from the start\nto be a particularly strong, ultra-light, very fast\ndesign and fun to drive – a new ‘Seven for the\n1990s’. The press and public certainly thought so\nand it quickly racked up numerous awards for\ndesign and innovation including Car of the Year\n(What Car?), Top Sports Car (BBC Top Gear\nMagazine) and Best Designed New Car (from a\npoll of Car Magazine readers). The new Lotus\nalso reached the finals of the prestigious Prince\nof Wales Award for Innovation, picking up many\nother awards across Europe along the way.\nThe novel construction, its all-up dry weight\nof only 690kg (1520lb) and hence the car’s\nextremely high power-to-weight ratio showed\nthe company moving in a new direction. By\nseeking to minimise weight rather than simply\nmaximising power, Lotus aimed to improve\non existing sports cars’ braking, handling and\nsteering responses, whilst simultaneously\nreducing to more acceptable levels overall fuel\n1996\nconsumption and carbon-dioxide emissions.\nWorking with Hydro Aluminium Automotive\nStructures (which had also assisted Renault\nwith the development of its rival, the heavier\nSport Spider), the Elise demonstrated an\nentirely new approach to vehicle architecture\nand brought to roadcar design a truly affordable\n‘spaceframe’ style structure. This was made of\nepoxy-bonded sections of anodised aluminium\nextrusions, the whole being clothed in\ncomposite body panels (constructed using the\ntraditional hand-lay system) styled by Hethel’s\nin-house design team. It also introduced\nLanxide aluminium metal-matrix composite\nbrake discs, just one of many world firsts\nclaimed for the innovative new model.\nThe car’s unique steel subframe carried\na transverse mounted Rover K-Series engine,\na 1.8-litre four-valve straight four developing\n118bhp and giving the car an effective 125mph\npotential top speed with a 0-60mph time of\naround 5.5 seconds. A particularly fine-tuned\nindependent suspension system, comprising\nupper and lower wishbones, co-axial coil-springs\nand inverted monotube dampers, ensured that\nthe new car could provide the handling to\nmatch. And, just as importantly, the Elise\nwas to be affordable.

This was solved by\nchanging to rubber mountings for the complete engine\nand drivetrain, but other major challenges, such as the\nstringent road emission requirements had to be worked\nthrough. In the end, it was only by the use of as many\nElise parts as possible that the final homologation papers\nwere obtained. This had to be completed by the 14th\nof April 1997 or the racecar wouldn’t even be allowed\non the grid, let alone to compete in its first race, and\nultimately the papers were actually flown out to the\ncircuit on the morning of the 14th, the day of the race.\nTo most observers it seemed that the two cars were\none and the same but there were many differences\nbetween the two, the most visually obvious being the\nrequirements for lighting on the road car, which\nnecessitated a minimum height for the dip-beam main\nlights. This was achieved by specifying different dampers\nthus enabling increased suspension travel with a higher\nride height. In its original evolution (above), the Type 115\nroadcar was not fitted with the air intake roof scoop seen\nin the image on the left; it was added at a later date by the\nnow current owner in an attempt to keep the engine cool\nwhen in traffic!\nThe inevitable compromises built into the roadcar\nmade it almost impossible to drive when it was first tested\nat Hethel. The incredibly heavy on/off clutch and race\nbred engine management system combined to make the\ncar difficult, to say the least. Richard Rackham who drove\nthe car on the test track at Hethel commented, “It had got\nwhat amounted to a switch for a clutch, coupled with\na soft mounted engine and transmission that we ended up\nwith to satisfy the drive by noise requirements. When you\nlet the clutch up, it was all drama. It took skill to actually\nget it moving, but it settled down once you’d got the clutch\nup and your eyeballs had adjusted to the sensation!”\n186"

        "content": "In 1997, Group Lotus and GTI Lotus Racing introduced\nwhat was to become arguably the most innovative Lotus\nhigh performance car to date. As the new Lotus GT1-\nclass contending racing car, developed specifically for the\npopular BPR/FIA GT Series, the Le Mans 24 Hour race\nand other endurance events, it had the potential to deliver\nspectacular results in that year’s championship and to\nbecome the most successful Lotus racing car since the\n1987 Type 99T\n. A road-going version, to be built only to\nspecial customer order, was also under development.\nIntense attention to detail and widespread use of\nadvanced materials enabled the new car to meet its target\nweight of just 900kg (in both race and road trim) with the\nLotus V8 engine from the Esprit providing in excess of\n550bhp for the racing versions while maintaining high\nlevels of reliability and durability. The single road-going\nType 115, built in its plain black carbon-fibre bodywork,\nwas restricted to 350bhp, the aluminium chassis of both\ntypes being reinforced with the addition of an integrated\nroll cage to cope with the extra power.\nAs a collaboration between the various Lotus\ncompanies and departments – Engineering, Design,\nMarketing and Racing – it was naturally enough seen\nas both a high speed test bed and a useful advertising\nmedium for all other Lotus products. Romano Artioli\nclaimed the new car “demonstrates our advanced\ncapabilities in these areas and has resulted in an\noutstanding new high performance sports car and\na winning GT racing car.”\nAn intensive testing programme that commenced\nGT1 Racecar\nType 115\nimmediately after the launch of the car indicated that it\nshould prove extremely competitive against the coming\nseason’s Porsche and McLaren rivals. Against these cars\nin 1996, the Type 114 Esprit had achieved outstanding\nresults, being a machine which even George Howard-\nChappell of GTI Lotus Racing admitted “was far from\nideal for the job.” However, with the input of new and\nadvanced technology from Lotus, and the commitment\nand dedication of an extremely professional GT racing\nteam, Chappell expressed his confidence in the new car.\nOnce again the car was styled in-house, using carbon-\nfibre to create an all-new body, a stunning design which\nwas both beautiful and functional, providing great stability\nand balance with minimum drag. Venting for the rear\nbrakes was as innovative as the car’s construction, cool air\nentering through intakes at the front of the car which\nchannelled it down the inside smooth surface of the\nchassis main beams directly onto the brake discs. A rear\nwing acted in conjunction with both the top and under\nbody sections of the car to create substantial downforce.\nThe car retained the highly-praised driving\ncharacteristics of the Esprit but further development\nof the racing engine was undertaken jointly by GTI\nLotus Racing and Lotus Engineering in a bid to further\nimprove its 1996 season performance.\nTransmission for both versions was via a six-speed\nHewland sequential gearbox, the first time a sequential\ngearbox of this sort had been fitted to a Lotus road car.\nThe AP Racing four-plate hydraulic clutch used on\nboth cars was similar to that employed by the Esprit V8.\nIn order to provide maximum rigidity, the chassis and\nsuspension of the standard Elise were heavily revised\nusing solid fully rose-jointed racing suspension pick-ups\nto ensure highly accurate, rigid, positive and direct\nfeedback. Race-spec Firth Rixson coil springs over Penske lightweight dampers were\nfitted to both road and racecars.\nWheels were competition-spec cast magnesium 18-inch Speedline, carrying Michelin\nPilot MXX3ZR18 tyres. Braking was by competition AP Racing six-piston machined\naluminium calipers at all four corners with 14-inch cast-iron discs as standard and the\noption of advanced Carbon Industrie carbon brake discs for the competition versions.\nThe GT1 racecar also featured an air-jacking system with two jacks at the rear and\nanother single piston unit under the nose of the car. The compressed air plug was\nlocated at the base of the windscreen on the right-hand side.\n"

        "content": "When Lotus presented the new Esprit V8GT in\nNovember of 1997, they claimed it was, “developed to\nmake the power and performance of the V8 engine\naccessible to more drivers. In order to do this, detail\nspecification had been minimised without compromising\nperformance and of course driver appeal.”\nAt the same time, the V8GT became the focus of\nthe Esprit continuous improvement programme and the\ndevelopment of this new addition to the Esprit range led\nto extensive mechanical and aesthetic refinements which\nincluded: a completely re-styled interior (which was also\nadopted on the full Esprit range), new heating and\nventilation controls, a revised gearbox system and selector\nmechanism, a refined ABS brake system, a new windscreen\nwiper system and an all new alarm system. “The V8GT\ncombines the engineering passion of the V8 with the pure\nmomentum of the GT3,” was how Lotus positioned the\nV8GT in their range.\nAt the same time as the V8GT was revealed, it was\nalso announced that by February of 1998, when the first\nof the customer GTs were to hit the showrooms, the\nstandard model Esprit V8, now sporting most of the\nGT car’s updates, would become known as the V8SE.\nAs for all the V8 Esprits, power on the GT was\nquoted at the usual 350bhp and 400Nm/295lbft of\ntorque. Performance from the flat-plane crankshaft twin-\nturbo engine was certainly never a V8 Esprit weakness,\nbut keeping it within the reach of customers beyond\nthe end of the century became increasingly difficult,\nespecially considering that it was only the American\ndealers and their customers keeping the Esprit production\nline workers in a job.\nThe first production evolution in the V8 line,\nthe V8GT arrived at the very end of 1997 and\nwould become the second largest production\nvariant amongst Esprit V8 ranks. Just over 200\nV8GTs were made in five years – and demand\nfor the car reassured Lotus they had made\nsome worthwhile changes over the original.\nThe SE and GT differed mostly in overall weight as\nwell as in standard equipment levels. The V8GT was\nquoted at 1325kg/2919lb in Lotus multi-language colour\nbrochures, versus 1380kg/3040lb for the SE. Yet Lotus\nthemselves, in a text only insert at the launch, quoted\nthe GT as only a 40kg/88lb advantage.\nAs usual, the big difference in weight came at the\nexpense of standard equipment, the GT being specified\nwithout air conditioning and minus Muirhead leather\nseats fitted out instead with the composite fixed-back,\nalcantara-clad bucket seats found on the GT3. Of\ncourse, all the deleted V8SE items were available\nas options on the V8GT\n.\nExternally, the main identifying feature of the\nsub-£50,000-priced GT was the lack of the large rear\nwing now standard equipment on the V8 (and V8SE)\nmodel. This was replaced by an integral low-level rear\nwing, which included a new centrally mounted, high-level\nbrake-light. The new design of 6-spoke wheel from\nmanufacturer AWI (17-inch front and 18-inch rear)\ncarried the same Michelin Pilot rubber as the regular\nV8. The V8GT\n, which was electronically limited\nto a maximum of 170mph, was never available in the\nUSA, and was described in the UKs CAR magazine\nas, “\nAbout as good as you can get in something with\nfour wheels and an engine.”\n1997\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit V8GT\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1997-2001\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n204\nENGINE TYPE\nTwin Turbo Lotus 918, 32-valve V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3506cc/350bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173.5in/74in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n95in\nWEIGHT\n2919lb/1324kg\nEsprit V8GT\nType 82\n188"

It could be easily identified by its\nimpressive new rear wing, one that in the words of Lotus,\n“was re-designed to improve its functionality and give the\ncar a more aggressive stance.” Rather than attached to\nthe sides of the rear body deck, the enlarged wing was\nnow mounted to the tailgate on two pillars, and offered\nmuch improved access to the luggage compartment.\nBy being higher, it also helped increase rear visibility\nfor the driver, while retaining high-speed stability. The\nnew wing also included a central, high level, stop lamp,\na feature brought over from the V8GT that soon spread\nthroughout the Lotus line of models.\nMODEL\nType 82\nNAME/FORMULA\nEsprit V8SE\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n1998-2001\nEXAMPLES BUILT\napprox. 600\nENGINE TYPE\nTwin Turbo Lotus 918, 32-valve V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3506cc/350bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173.5in/74in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n95in\nWEIGHT\n3040lb/1379/kg\nThe six-spoke ‘Saturn’ wheels (8.5x17-inch front\nand 10.0x18inch rear) from supplier OZ were also\nre-designed with slightly narrower more elegant spokes\nwhich had softer edges, as well as a centre cap that\ncovered the wheel studs. The Michelin MXX3 tyres\nof huge 235/40ZR17 and 285/35ZR18 sizes were now\nspecified for all Esprit models except the GT3, and in all\nother aspects remained the same as the previous years car.\nThe SE featured the tilting roof panel that had by now\nbecome standard on all Esprit models.\nEsprit V8SE\nType 82\n1998\nTop speed of the SE was quoted as 5mph higher than that of the V8GT at\n175mph, although this was only due to a difference in the settings of the max-speed\nlimiter, which on the V8GT was set a little lower (the larger wing on the V8SE providing\nmore aero stability at near maximum mph). The 0-60 time of just 4.8 seconds was\nthe same for the V8SE as on the V8GT though.\nAt a list price of £59,950 the full-leather interior and air-conditioning was of\ncourse included, and therefore the list of options available was small, but did include\ndriver’s airbag, metallic paint, sports seats, seat piping, Alcantara headlining, and\nan Alpine CD player. The ‘sports seats’ were in fact simply the lightweight option\nfitted to the GT as standard.\nThe modified clutch and gear-shift which had been adopted on the V8GT when it\nwas launched were also carried over to the SE and all subsequent models, and by 1999,\nthe Brembo brake system on both models was replaced by a new AP Racing cross-drilled\n320mm two-piece brake disc set-up at the front. The rear end stayed with the smaller\nsingle piston Brembo calipers but were now mounted on new brackets which\naccommodated the larger two-piece drilled discs. Also introduced at this time was\na revised engine management system which, as with the brake set-up, came from the\nSport 350. This modification was said to enhance torque in lower gears and provide\nbetter in-gear acceleration and greater flexibility on demanding roads.\n"

The tyre supplier was changed from the previous\nMichelin to Pirelli, their P-Zero line 235/40 and\n295/35ZRs, fitted onto 17-inch and 18-inch OZ\nCrono Mag rims.\nIn answer to customer demands for an appropriate\nincrease in braking power to accompany Esprit’s fabled\ngo and turn strengths, the Sport 350 offered the\ncompany’s strongest commitment yet to torso-popping\ndeceleration. Kelsey-Hayes ABS provided electronic skid\ncontrol for the 320mm/12.6 inch AP Racing discs all\nround, which were both cross-drilled and ventilated. The\nAP 4-piston calipers proved capable of 60-0 times in the\nwet which were just 0.2sec higher than the acclaimed\nEsprit GT3 in the dry! Stopping distances were reduced\naccordingly. Autocar magazine tested a Sport 350 and\nwere impressed with the braking capabilities, “Up front,\nfour-pot AP Racing calipers chomp on 320mm discs,\nwhile at the back there are similarly vast discs with two-\npot calipers, not to mention a bespoke Kelsey-Hayes\nanti-lock system. At last, it seems. Lotus has addressed the\nEsprit’s painfully obvious braking problems.”\nWeight loss was achieved with hand-laid body panels,\nthe fiendishly expensive OZ magnesium wheels and the\ntwin aluminium pylons for a carbon-fibre rear wing.\nGenuine carbon-fibre rather than the common\n‘lookalikes’ in the cockpit also assisted. This was applied\nto the instrument binnacle and centre vent covers, as\nwell as also being used for the centre console and\ncentral switchgear surrounds.\nThe cabin was also enhanced by a Momo steering\nwheel. What accounted for one of the biggest\nimprovements on the scales was simply moving air\nconditioning onto the options list so its weight could\nbe discounted compared to the original Esprit V8. Also\non the options list were airbags and audio components.\nLotus described the Sport 350 as, “the most extreme and\nfocused development of the classic Esprit supercar ever to\nreach the market,” when they revealed preliminary details\nin October 1998. Owners of the Sport 300 could point at\nmore deviations from then standard specification than V8\nowners were offered, for the V8 motor was only altered in\ndetail and retained the usual 350bhp peak claim, but the\nSport 350 recalled Sport 300 pricing (£64,950) and did\noffer major chassis changes, plus the most extrovert rear\nwing of the many that have adorned the Esprit over its life.\nContrasting silver and a steel blue with a grey shade\nbecame the official colour combination for the Sport 350.\nThe grey was the primary colour with flecks of blue\nstreaking around the nose, along the side sills and their\nintakes, finished off with a Sport 350 decal across the\ntop edge of the tailgate. A blue theme also topped out\nthe engine rocker covers and injection casting, with blue\nAlcantara cloth finish for the slim and deeply contoured\ncomposite seats.\nHaving said this, not every Sport 350 was created\nequal. Lotus records show that there were 50 production\nSport 350s, 44 in the standard colours: Then three in\nblack, two in Monaco White and a single example in solo\nSteel Blue. Additionally, eight cars were sent to the USA,\nbut they were not all to 100% genuine Sport 350\nspecification, although that should not worry owners\nas they are even rarer!\nTo boost performance there was the claimed loss\nof 80kg/176lb and a recalibration of the V8’s ECM\n(Electronic Computer Module, or ‘brain’) “revising the\ntorque application in the lower gears, giving quicker\nin-gear acceleration,” reported Lotus in 1998. Certainly\n50-70mph had now dropped to an independently timed\n5.8 seconds in fifth, plus a lightning 2.6 seconds in third,\nwas at least two seconds faster than the contemporary\nBMW M3. That ratio also demonstrated the wide range\nof power the V8 brought to Esprit, third gear could take\nyou from 27mph to almost 100mph at 7000rpm.\n"

At the 1998 British Motorshow,\nLotus received a large number of requests for an official\nfactory built 135bhp Elise, and a month later the decision\nwas made to produce the Elise Sport 135. The engine\nhowever was not the only upgrade.\nIn November of 1998 the Sport 135 model was\nlaunched as a limited run of 50 blue in tinted metallic\nsilver paint branded ‘Quicksilver’. Offered with standard\nexternal Elise appearance (barring 135 and SPORT\ndecals), the 135 benefitted from lowered suspension,\nre-valved (stiffened) Koni dampers, and a stiffened\nfront anti-roll bar. The result was, to some, a reduction\nin compliance over pockmarked British country lanes,\nbut superb for those ever more popular track days.\nOther additions for the limited first production run\nincluded a close-ratio gearbox, sports exhaust, cast iron\ndrilled brake discs, dark blue hood, red (most cars)\nCorbeau competition-style sport seats (left), silver roll\nover bar, racing steering wheel, an alloy-topped gear\nlever, headlamp covers, driving lights, and of course\nthe unique Sport 135 body graphics.\nThe price for the 135, with all the motor uprates was\ncertainly high at £28,950, but for most people, the engine\npower increase and close ratio gears transformed the\nstandard car, and were well worth the price. The Elise\nSport 135 would go on to become probably the best\nvalue-for-money after market or second-hand Elise\nyou could buy.\nBetween the Elise Sport conversions and the\nintroduction of the first major engine change derivative\n(the 111S), Lotus again entered into the limited edition\nbusiness with the Elise. The first was a 50th Anniversary\nEdition in late 1998 and early 1999, with just 50 made in\nthe emotive dark green Team Lotus colours that pre-dated\nsponsorship from Gold Leaf cigarettes. At this time Lotus\nalso re-angled the rear window glass to help reduce\nreflections, but the big news that month was more\npower and a new engine for the Elise. A second batch\nof 35 cars were produced in 1999 and had the new\nstyle 111S wheels, a black painted fuel\nfiller cap, matt finish alloy gear knob\nand Sport 135 ‘99’ decals.\n192"

At its heart was an extensively modified\nversion of the standard 1.8-litre engine – each\nmeticulously hand-built by race technicians at Hethel –\nkicking out a breathtaking 190bhp.\nThis mighty powerplant was known, appropriately,\nas the VHPD, or Very High Performance Derivative, and\ncould hurl the featherweight Sport 190 from standstill to\n60mph in 4.3secs (0-100km/h in 4.4secs) and to 100mph\nin a supercar-bashing 10.72secs.\nAs you would expect with this extraordinary level\nof performance, the Sport 190 was equipped with\ncompetition modified suspension, brakes, wheels and\ntyres, and an ultra-close-ratio gearbox, all fitted and set\nup by the same technicians who developed the car.\nBecause each of the 48 Sport 190 was specially built to\norder by the Lotus aftermarket department (the prototype\ncar pictured here was distinctively painted Chrome\nGreen), each car could be tailored to specific customer\nrequests; the list of options was extensive.\nThe VHPD engine was the familiar transversely\nmid-mounted four-cylinder in-line, dohc, four valves\nper cylinder unit. Changes over the standard engine\ncomprised of a modified cylinder head, valves, pistons,\ncrankshaft, flywheel, solid valve lifters (used to permit\nincrease in maximum revs to 8000rpm), a carbon-fibre\nair-box assembly, oil cooler kit, and a lightweight\ncompetition silencer and tailpipe.\nThe capacity of the all-aluminium unit remained at\n1796cc but maximum power was of course up to 190bhp\n– to match the 190 name – at 7500rpm, and the peak\ntorque of the engine (139lbft) was reached at 5600rpm.\nPerformance was vastly improved, with top speed quoted\nat 145mph and the 0-60mph time quoted easily\nachievable.\nThe Sport 190 suspension upgrade kit included Koni\ncompetition-spec dampers (with Lotus modifications) all\nround, Lotus-patented extruded aluminium front uprights\nand uprated adjustable anti-roll bar, and adjustable spring\nplatforms to lower the ride height of the double-wishbone\nset-up.

At the back,\nnew 7.5x16-inch 6-spoke alloys wore 225/45 rears\nrather than 205/50s on 7-inch rims. Front wheels, also\nof the 6-spoke design, remained at 5.5x15-inch, with\na 185/55 rubber also from Pirelli.

Many\nwould argue that it was only at this point that the initial\nbugs in the radical Elise design were well and truly\nsorted out, and that a post January 1999 Elise\nrepresents the best used car Elise option.\nThe remainder of 1999 saw Lotus back in the\nlimited edition business with a vengeance. July of\nthat year saw the iconic black and gold JPS style livery\nlast seen on the 1978 Series 2 Esprit, applied liberally\ninside and outside for 70-plus Elises, in either 111S\nor standard power train formats. This was the first\ntime Lotus brought the transparent headlamp cowls\nin from the option lists to equip all the 118bhp black\nand gold models.\nBy October 1999, a red and white Type 49 (Gold\nLeaf Team Lotus) tribute finish was available on 111S\nor standard Elise (see page 195) and finally amongst\nthe 1999 special Elises came October’s Elise\nMillennium. Again applied to both the standard and\n111S models, the Atlantis blue bodies had Alcantara\nblue steering wheel and black and blue seats and\ntrim panels.\nIn November 1999 there was announcement of\nan extremely important structural change on the Elise:\nthe adoption of redesigned forged steel hub carriers at\nthe rear, replacing the extruded aluminium originals.\nAlthough this would ultimately not take effect until\nthe introduction of the (at this time) ‘top-secret’\nSeries 2 re-design, this important introduction was\novershadowed by a major new Elise derivative,\nthe 340R which would go into production in 2000."

        "content": "Considering the simplicity of the idea, reverting to the\noriginal “Step-In” philosophy of no hood, no doors and\nminimalist mudguards on an Elise base, the 340R took\na while to arrive on the scene.\nOfficially created in collaboration with UK motoring\nmagazine Autocar, the 340R was first shown as a concept\nat the October 1998 Birmingham Motor Show, but 340R\nproduction did not start until around 12 months later, and\nthe 340 customers, (roughly a third in LHD) did not start\ntaking delivery until the spring of 2000. Although the\n340R was a terrific track car, benefiting particularly from\na new generation of A038 Yokohama tyres on unique\n12-spoke 6x15 and 8x16-inch wheels, it was the brainchild\nof Russell Carr at Lotus Design, rather than the\nengineering division. Ultimately, it was getting that basic\nstarkness to the customers in a slightly more practical and\naerodynamically stable form that took the most time.\nAt the August 1999 London launch of the £35,000\nproduction version, Lotus Chief Designer Russell Carr\ncommented that, “the clients stayed loyal to the concept.\nWe were worried they would see it as some sort of Lotus\nSeven carry-over, but the 340R was much more\nsophisticated than that. Our start came from the\nscreen-less Elise Sprint Show Car designed 1996 by\nJulian Thomson, who had left Lotus by the time we\ncame to advance the 340R themes. I did the original\nconcept for the 340R, but Steve Crijns did the revised\nproduction version and we had four modellers working\non the project from 1998 onward.”\nFollowing that Autumn 1998 show car (opposite page\nand below), the board at Lotus gave approval for the\nproject to go ahead. Now the six-strong hardcore\nengineering and design team started to grapple with the\nrealities of European Type Approval and the\naerodynamic results turned in by Richard Hill working at\nMIRA. Lotus recorded 12 major changes over the show\ncar and it looked even more aerodynamically radical than\nthe original concept version.\nChief changes prompted by the wind tunnel were a\nrear wing mounted on pylons and raked rather than the\n1998 raised lip layout. Once again rear end down force\nwas sought, but the front biplane wing set also became\nmore effective: featuring an elongated bib front spoiler\nframed with vertical strakes that connected to an upper\nwing surface, both elements improved the original design’s\nfront-end aerodynamic characteristics significantly.\nCooling was also a major concern solved in the wind\ntunnel. Deeper front radiator ducts complemented an\nenlarged front grille, which was adorned with a brace\nof driving lamps. The main side panels were reprofiled\nto direct more air into the engine bay, resulting in an\neven more extreme – and durable – version of the 340R\nthan had been envisaged.\nOther engineering changes over the 1998 projections for the 340R comprised\nextended mudguards (also aerodynamically beneficial) and a serious assault on noise\nlevels to meet type approval legislation. The engine, with a re-routed exhaust system,\nwas encased with a removable sound insulating rear panel and Titan supplied a noise\nsuppression butterfly. Track cars could have alternative (non catalytic converter) exhaust\nsystem and the noise suppression panel removed. The Lotus engine management system\ncould unleash the track-only 190bhp if you took an exchange Electronic Control Unit\n(ECU) from Lotus at £349. Standard performance was strongest on acceleration, but\nto really get the best from 340R on track, the production gearbox could easily be\nreplaced with a Quaife track box, equipped with ratios that were better suited to\nkeeping the higher-powered engine in the 4000-8000rpm power bands.\nReplacement rear lamp clusters with a high-level third brake light were integrated\ninto the rear along with a fog lamp. Lotus also designed some unique wrap-around\nseats and the interior was made over once again by the Design department’s Matthew\nHill. The open cockpit was topped by a unique figure-eight rollover double hoop made\nby the UK company Safety Devices.\nAs Lotus emphasised the track nature of 340R, specialist Stack track monitoring\noptions were offered, but the unique Techno magnesio wheels with centre lock wheel\nnut system (see above) were not offered as a standard fitment. The accessories list for\n340R ran to a massive 75 items in the launch year. Available in the ‘Lotus 340R\nAccessories’ brochure this would mean that customers could spend more than £40,000\non the dramatic Elise-based car. In spite of this, 170 excited future owners put down\ndeposits prior to the start of production.\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise 340R\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2000\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n340\nENGINE TYPE\nUprated Rover VHPD K-Series 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/177bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n142.5in/65in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n1325lb/601kg\n"

The 160 was\nalways destined for the showroom as well as the\ntrack, powered by a seriously redeveloped power\nunit that dated back to Rover’s proposed one-\nmake series for their 200 model in 1995 (which\nwas dropped after the BMW take-over of Rover).\nThe Elise Sport 160 had a much simpler\nproduction life than the 190, serving as a hugely\npopular run-out horsepower special. Just 319\nwere made in two batches, and the specification\nwas as flexible as that of any Elise, with some\nimportant options.\nThe first 50 Sport 160 cars underwent Single\nVehicle type Approval (SVA) testing, and were\nbuilt at the factory with catalytic converters and\n‘Sport’ exhaust mufflers to produce 160PS.\nThe Elise Sport 160 was introduced in February\nof 2000 as a high performance derivative of\nthe Elise aimed at customers who wanted an\nincreased level of dynamic specification for\nuse on both the road and track.\nSubsequent cars were Whole Vehicle Type\nApproved (WVTA) and factory built with catalytic\nconverters, 111S exhaust mufflers and dual-intake\nair-cleaner/muffler assemblies to produce\napproximately 150bhp. Many of these cars were\nsubsequently converted to 160PS specification\nat the customers’ request.\nThe basic specification mated a non-VVC\nengine rated at 151PS at 7000rpm (just under\n150bhp) with a standard ratio Elise 5-speed\ngearbox, fitted with the Sport uprated springs\nand dampers, plus an adjustable front anti-roll\nbar and ball-jointed rear track control arms.\nSeveral performance features of the 111S,\nincluding the secondary level rear wing and the\n225 Pirelli P Zero tyres, completed the package.\nThe 5-spoke grey wheels were by MIM and the\nrears were 8x16s, another half-inch larger than\n111S and an inch more than the entry level Elise.\nThe interior was overhauled to complement\nthe mechanical upgrades. Alcantara inserts on\nthe seats and the usual 3-spoke steering wheel\nwere fitted, with the seats having a deeper\ncontour than the starter and 111S Elises.

By Spring of 2000 a more sinister all-black\ndescendant was readied for press assessment, now rolling\non Rimstock 7x16-inch and 8.5x17-inch cast alloys.\nThroughout development, Yokohama supplied the\nmandatory radial race rubber, which was finalised as\n195/580R at the front and 230/625R at the rear.\nBraking was by 295mm, cross-drilled front discs with\n4-piston AP Racing calipers, and the rears were also listed\nas showroom 282mm units. These were changed to larger\n295mm units for the 2000-01 seasons. Initially these were\nreported as 2-piston calipers at the back, later becoming\n4-piston, then reverting to 2-piston calipers. However there were always brake balance\nadjustment valving and Mintex pads available all round. Primary statistics such as the\nweight (700kg), power (quoted 200 to 203bhp at 7750rpm and the use of Quaife\ninternals for the straight cut gearing of the 5-speed transaxle remained throughout the\ngestation period prior to the opening (2nd April 2000) 15 lap race at Brands Hatch.\nLotus predicted 130mph at an 8000rpm maximum on shorter track gearing.\nThe 0-60mph dash was anticipated at 4.2 seconds and 0-100mph in around ten seconds.\nThe 2000 Autobytel Lotus Championship was won convincingly by Adam Wilcox\nin the Nortel Networks car. Adam won eight of the 14 rounds, including all three of\nthe overseas events (Spa, Nürburgring and Magny-Cours). The ‘works’ celebrity car\nwas driven by several prominent ‘names’ including Ex-Lotus F1 driver Martin Donnelly,\nShane Lynch of the band Boyzone, and a number of motoring journalists.

The\nproduction K-Series engine boasting 177bhp or\n190bhp was shared with the 340R, as was the\n5-speed gearbox and 4.2 final drive. Launch price\nwas initially fixed at £32,995 (but soon dropped\nby £2000), less than the £33,500 asked for the first\nElise Sport 190 or the £35,000 for the 340R.\nCompared to the Elise Sport racers, the biggest\nchange that Russell Carr’s design team had to\nface was improving road going aerodynamic\ndownforce over that of any other Elise. They\nalso replaced racetrack impracticalities, adding\nbigger clearances for the new front splitter and\nabandoning the central driving position of the\nsingle seat race-bred competitors.\nMost visibly, the front apron/splitter was\nraised to allow access over the humps that clutter\nmodern streets and car park access areas. To\ncontinue to deliver effective down force with\na minimalist undertray/diffuser and still meet\nEuropean safety regulations, the rear wing and its\ntwo pylons had to be rounded off. Instead\nof merely claiming to reduce rear-end uplift,\nRichard Hill and the aerodynamicsic department\ndelivered downforce of 80kg at 100mph, split 45kg\nat the rear and 35kg forward. The drag coefficient\nwas reported as the usual Elise figure (circa 0.36),\na fair achievement with the widest wheels\n(Rimstock 7Jx16 fronts and 8.5x17-inch rears) and\nappropriate A039 Yokohamas tyres (of 195 and\n225 profiles) yet seen on a production Elise.\nThe cold-air-intake was smoothed into the\nroof and an extractor for hot engine bay air was\nprovided aft, along with a new, polycarbonate\ntailgate that opened for baggage and engine\naccess. The cowled headlamps were assisted by\ntwo auxiliary front lights fitted into the corners of\nthe grille/air intake. The body accommodated the\nusual Elise 40-litre/8.8 imperial gallon fuel tank\nand asked for nothing more than the cheaper 95\noctane unleaded. The 2-seat cockpit was home\nto the Stack instrumentation, plus the engine\nmanagement controller from Lotus (K4 series).\nThe other electrical units that could require\nservice were hidden beneath a cover. Statistically\nthe Exige owed most to the stretches and tucks of\nthe 2000-2001 season Autobytel racers and made\na fascinating number-crunching comparison with\nthe first Elise and with the development of the\nfirst generation Elise family.\nOfficially launched prior to the first round\nof the 2000 Autobytel race series at Brands Hatch,\nthe Exige was the true inheritor of the Elite or\nEuropa Twin-Cam reputation as the smallest\nand quickest of Lotus Coupés and remained quite\na rarity. The Exige was most certainly a track\nday favourite and became used widely by racing\nschools as well as the few lucky owners fortunate\nenough to have ordered one early. The experience\nfor many in just such a track car, even one\nequipped with the 177bhp production motor\n(listed at £32,995), rather than the optional\n7800rpm 190bhp track-pack motor, was\nsomething quite special.\nThe Lotus Exige was simply sensational and\nwould fly by almost everything on the average\ntrack day, including 450-600bhp GT2/3 Porsches\nselling for up to three times the price. It could be\ntough to overtake the more powerful cars on the\nstraights, but any sniff of a corner and the Exige’s\nfantastic brakes and superior grip would see the\nlittle Lotus overhaul pretty much all the high\npower, high budget opposition quite effortlessly.\nBritish magazine Autocar was loaned an Exige\nto run on the road and it was reportedly a deeply\nsatisfying drive, if something of a noise and\ntemperature trial. The air-conditioning option\nwas not listed on the original April 2000 factory\nbrochure, but needed to be regarded as\na necessity for anybody planning to take their\nExige motoring regularly on public roads and\nthrough their associated traffic jams. Writing\nfor EVO magazine in September 2000, Richard\nMeaden summarised the test Exige (W311 TVF\nwith 192bhp specification) with the comment:\n“If you like your cars to have an equal quotient\nof power and poise, a harmony of grunt and grip\nthat enables you to exploit every ounce of forward\nmotion and wring the last drop of mechanical\ngrip from the chassis (not to mention a little bit\nextra from thin air) then the Exige has your name\nwritten all over it.”\nDevelopment of the Exige required harvesting\npieces from almost every quarter of the Elise\nparts bin, but the result was a coupé that earned\nrave press reviews and more than 600 sales in\nits short (in Series 1 form) manufacturing life.\nExige\nType 111\nMilestone Car\n“If you like your cars to have an equal quotient of power and\npoise, and a harmony of grunt and grip, then the Exige has\nyour name written all over it.”\nRichard Meaden\n202"

Steve Crijns\ncommented, “We wanted to create a shape that\nwould reflect an incredible driving experience.\nThe car has to look a hell of a lot more exciting\nthan your every-day two-seater Cabrio. But\nwe also wanted to be honest and not have any\nfeatures just for stylistic effect.”\n“We started by shrink-wrapping the bodywork\naround the mechanical components” Crijns\ncontinued, “Very early in the design phase, the\nfull size clay model went to the wind-tunnel where\nthe rear spoiler and rear diffuser were created to\noptimise down force without causing drag.”\nA new rear diffuser in composite material\naugmented the regular Elise alloy panel flat\nunder-floor sections and, in conjunction with the\nElise S2’s increased length, was more effective.\nSome motoring experts may have felt that the\nElise went soft in its second edition but they were\nno doubt deceived by the enhanced practicality\n(bigger boot, larger doorway access) and an\noptions list that took in carpets, radio and, by\n2002, even air-conditioning. Lotus engineers\nmanaged the apparently impossible feat of\nstiffening up the chassis while simultaneously\nmaking the responses on the ragged edge a lot\nsafer for an increased percentage of customers.\nCritical paths to such unlikely progress were the\nbespoke Bridgestone tyres and the installation\nof Bilstein high pressure damping instead of the\nKonis previously used.\nForged steel hub-carriers replaced the original\nextruded aluminium ones, and were accompanied\nby new wishbones, bushes and mounting points\nfor the aforementioned dampers. Both front and\nrear track was increased, as were the camber\nsetting at the rear, whilst the chassis ride-height\nwas lowered.\nThe other tangible customer benefit of the\nS2 Elise was a far higher level of exterior finish\nbrought about by the use of a new process for\nmanufacturing the all-new composite body\npanels. A complete change of design philosophy\nled to a closed mould system that gave stronger,\nlighter panels, with a much improved finish.\nThe K-Series engine was slightly revised to\ninclude Lotus K4 electronic management, rather\nthan the versatile Rover systems of the first\nedition. This was rated as having an extra 2bhp\n(120bhp), with the official maximum torque peak\nflattened to cover a 1000rpm mid-range plateau,\nand making the Series 2 Elise a little more useable\nthan before.\n2000\nElise (Series 2)\nType 111\nIntroduced at the Birmingham Motor Show\nin October 2000, the second-generation\nElise featured a heavily restyled body and\ninterior; a revised soft top; revised door\nwindow guides; chassis side-rails lowered\nat cockpit sides; revised suspension with\nnew hubs and steel hub carriers; a revised\nengine spec; and larger diameter road\nwheels fitted with Bridgestone Potenza\ntyres rather than the previous Pirellis.\n204"

This\nwas possibly due to the small rise in kerb weight. Fuel\nconsumption was practically unaltered whilst emission\nperformance was improved such that the Elise was now\nplaced in the cheaper British Government tax brackets\nand conformed with Euro 3 emission levels.\nAutocar summarised the Series 2 Elise succinctly\nwhen they wrote: “Does the impossible – betters the\noriginal Elise. Ride handling and engine are improved\non a car we thought was untouchable.”\nThe new car certainly came with a new more\nimmediate surge of power and was the best electronically\nmanaged Elise (until the new 111S came along). With\na taut chassis, rigid Eibach springs and stout Bilsteins,\nthe S2 Elise certainly responded well to the drivers’\ncommands and, on turn-in to a corner, could even be\nconsidered superior to some single seat racers! The same\nexhilarating abilities and reassuring consistency were\napplicable to the brakes, which were more durable than\neven the MMC units fitted to early Elises. The 135\nmodel’s breathtaking overtaking ability, a consequence\nof the accessible and flexible 2000 to 7000rpm power\nrange, was well and truly in the motorcycle league.\nThe fuel consumption was more like a motorcycle too,\nand independent test figures even averaged 42.4mpg,\nincluding test track mileage which recorded an indicated\n135mph (true 129mph) while using 4500-6800rpm\nregularly for three of five tanks of fuel. Close to 40mpg\nwas now a realistic figure for the Elise and the simple\nmodifications to the cylinder head, air-intake and air-\nbox, as well as a new sports exhaust, transformed the\nshowroom Elise into a quite formidable British A-road\n(and B-road!) performer.\nThe exhilarating performance of the new model\nwas accompanied by some running changes that made\nevery-day life with an Elise much easier. After a few\npractice runs, the new hood design was certainly much\nmore manageable and rapid to errect when under\npressure from inclement weather, whilst one could even\nmanage to pack a little more luggage for a few nights\nat a hotel in the larger sized rear luggage space.\nThe chassis dynamics, on the standard Bridgestone\nPotenzas of 16 and 17-inch diameters were outstanding,\nand the Series 2 Elise certainly came across as a much\nmore genuine international alternative to the more\nconventional, mass-produced sports car choices available.\nMost certainly the new Elise had a pretty extensive\nand imposing repertoire and had without doubt become\na much better finished and manufactured product than\nthe earlier editions.\n"

        "content": "2002\nIn 2002, after many aborted attempts and\npremature media predictions of its demise, it\nreally was time for farewell to the Esprit. As the\nSport 350 drew to the end of its 2001 run, Lotus\nearnestly sought suppliers for yet another small\nscale batch of components to ease just 82\nEsprit ‘Final Editions’, all built to American\nspecification, off the assembly lines at Hethel.\nEsprit Final Edition\nType 82\nbolting the two units together. After this, the doors and\nglass were fitted, before the interior was trimmed to\ncustomer order.\nEach car was subject to enhanced quality control\nchecks, examined in detail within a brightly lit inspection\nbay. Any problems were then rectified by a specialist\nfinishing crew wearing special protective clothing. The\nfinal testing stage before each of the last Esprits was\nshipped, proved its considerable capabilities on the\nLotus test track.\nThe Final Edition Esprit continued to use the double\nwishbone, coil-spring/telescopic damper set up at the\nfront and the upper/lower transverse link with box-section\nradius arm configuration at the rear. The spring/damper\nunits were rated to deliver an even more sporting bias\n(but not as extreme as for the Sport 350), while retaining\nthe standard ride height of the car. Bilstein dampers had\nstiffened settings, equipped with adjustable threaded\nspring platforms offering easier ride height adjustment.\nThe Eibach conical road springs, fitted at both front and\nrear, were uprated and combined with the dampers to\ngive the last Esprits a distinct feedback. Suspension\ngeometry remained unchanged, set at the mid-laden\nride height of 170/163mm front/rear.\nThe power output of the twin-turbocharged V8\nremained at 350bhp and was balanced by the stopping\npower of the four ventilated disc brakes which had the\nKelsey-Hayes 430, 3-channel ABS fitted as standard.\nAluminium accents added flair to the interior of\n‘The Final Edition’. The leather gearlever gaiter, secured\nat its base by an aluminium bezel, accompanied a new\nshorter gear lever knob finished in brushed aluminium\nand topped with a Lotus badge. Coupled with the\naluminium trim on the instrument cluster, this effect\nheightened the interior’s high tech appearance. The\nleather trimmed seating of ‘The Final Edition’ seats\nfeatured a distinctive new stitch pattern.\nPerhaps the most critical component was the Renault\nsourced rear transaxle gearbox and associated driveshafts.\n“During the V8 run a massive improvement in shift\nquality occurred transferring cables across to the hot\n[exhaust] side of the eight,” reported Brian Angus, but\nit was not all good news. “We were told in 2000 that the\nplant at Limouges was to shut, affecting our supplies from\n2003,” reported Angus, adding in summary, “however\nwe bought the last 100 boxes to support and service our\ncustomers from December 2003 onward. I must say\nRenault’s transmission staff treated us extremely fairly\nand there was always enthusiasm and loyalty for our\nproduct, even when it was a direct rival to the French\nbuilt Alpine Renault V6 models.”\nHe then reminded us all, “... the Esprit would not\nhave lived anything like the life it did, or been such a\nsatisfying drive, if it had not been for the giants like\nGeneral Motors, Toyota and Renault, despite our tiny\nsupply orders. If I had to pick out one supreme example\nit would have to be GM around the World – especially\ndivisions like Delco, Rochester and Saginaw – for their\nhelp in progressing the Esprit through fuel injection,\nengine managements, power steering, ABS braking and\nso many safety items that were initially demanded in\nthe USA, such as airbags, that are now commonplace\nworldwide!”\nThe ‘Final Edition’ Esprits were hand built by a team\nof 20 dedicated technicians, some of whom worked on\nthe Esprit production line for over 15 years. Each new\nEsprit took seven days to complete its journey down\nthe assembly line, just one left the factory each day and\noccupied 584 hours to build.\nThe assembly line began with the backbone chassis,\nwhich cradled the twin turbo V8 engine and onto which\nthe suspension, wheels and brakes attached. Meanwhile,\nthe fully painted composite and Kevlar bodyshell mated\nto the chassis, simply by connecting up all the wiring and"

The Lotus roundel – previously only\nused on the headrest of each seat – could now\nbe found embossed on the centre of the\npassenger airbag cover on the fascia. Whilst\nthere were new interior trim options in terms\nof leather colour, the fascia trim on all Final\nEditions came in black only. For these final\nEsprits, the climate control panel used new\nstyle knobs of a brushed aluminium design.\nThere were several subtle changes on the\nexterior for the very last of the last Esprits,\nwhich visually separated them from the ’03\nmodel year cars made and assembled earlier\nin 2003.\nAll the grille sections in the front spoiler, as\nwell as those in the lift-out engine cover, were\nnow in an unpainted stainless steel mesh\nmaterial, rather than the black painted grilles\nof the ’03MY cars. The other obvious change\nwas the stainless steel perforated rear valance\nwhich was restyled with three rows of more\noval slots instead of the previous round\napertures, and it also had a fresh bead-blasted,\nsatin finish. The twin tail-pipes now exited\nthrough the centre of the valance rather than\nat either side.

He helped build the first\npre-production Esprit in 1975 and was there to see the last Esprit off the line.\nThe very last car carried the VIN 10621, which turned out to be a yellow\nV8 bound for an American collector specializing in Lotus. Just one car –\nVIN 10508 – was retained by the Lotus Cars product engineering department\nat Hethel."

        "content": "2002\nOriginally releasing two models, the base Elise 111, a pure\npower upgrade model with spartan interior, and a higher\nspecified 111S model, Lotus soon realised that most\npeople were ordering the base 111 with the extra £2000\noption package (that effectively turned it into a 111S) and\nbefore the end of the year dropped the 111 from the\nrange, simply listing the car as the 111S. The 111S model\nwas predicted to comfortably out-perform the 135 Sport\nafter-market option, if only because it had another\n21bhp. It was a much faster (on paper, at least) and more\nexpensive Elise flagship, introduced at £27,995. However,\nAutocar noted that the Elise Sport 135, “posted an\nidentical 0-100mph time,” and concluded of the 111S,\n“it may not be the best Elise to drive – the 135 is more\ninvigorating – but the 111S is a fine compromise between\ndynamic excellence and customer usability.”\nThe 111S’s replacement close ratio (G6) gearbox now\nhad a taller top gear than the basic Elise (and the 135) and\nthe 156bhp 111S engine delivered its power so seamlessly\nthat it almost felt as if it wasn’t really pulling its weight.\nThe unique set of close gear ratios included a motorway\nuseful fifth gear, which gave the bonus of improved fuel\neconomy. Lotus also overhauled water and oil cooling,\nand made some useful exterior changes which included\nminor changes to the soft top release mechanism.\nThe chassis dynamics, on the standard Bridgestone\nPotenzas of 16 and 17-inch diameters, were outstanding\nand the Elise S2 certainly came across as a much more\ngenuine alternative to the rather more conventional,\nmass-produced sports car choices available. The\nacclaimed suspension, sensitive steering and prompt\nbraking components were unchanged over that of the\nbasic Elise, so the 111S remained supremely enjoyable\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise 111S\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2002-05\nEXAMPLES BUILT\napprox. 2,000\nENGINE TYPE\nRover K-Series VVC\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/156bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149in/67.5in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n1777lb/806kg\non road or track. Unlike the early models, the Elise 2\nwould slide forgivingly and was certainly easier to drive\nfor the less expert driver. Yet the Elise 111S still delivered\na drive that entertained the professionals.\nFor UK Company Car tax payers, the 111S offered\na truly realistic prospect of an exotic sports car (and a\nLotus at that) to impress their neighbours. With its\ntaxable CO2 output listed at just 163g/km, lower than\nthe standard Elise – lower even than a Ford KA – the\ncompany Fleet Buyers were allowed to consider the\n111S. With more of the refinements expected of a\nmodern ‘Daily Driver’ now finding their way onto the\nElise, the 111S was a real attempt to entice customers\naway from the BMW and Porsche models that were\nprobably out of their price range.\nLater in 2002 a Sport 190 variation on the 111S\nconcept was also released. This limited run of just 33\ncars featured the 187bhp VHPD version of the K-Series\npower unit and had a special bluish silver paint with\ngloss black 16-spoke wheels.\nMost certainly the new Elise 2 in 111S form had\na pretty extensive and imposing repertoire and had\ncertainly become a much better finished and\nmanufactured product than the first edition. However,\nsome people felt that it needed some bigger brothers\nand further Elise technology spin-offs to face the\nfuture confidently. The Elise was created to save weight,\nincrease performance and fuel consumption, and save\nLotus. Now the most popular Lotus ever – production\nsurpassed the first Elan which sold 12,224 units – the Elise\nallowed Lotus to be reborn under Proton of Malaysia\nownership and ensured that we would see many more\nderivatives of the Elise theme.\nElise 111S\nType 111\nComing on-line in May of 2002, the new 111S\nfeatured the Rover K-Series VVC engine, along\nwith revised transmission ratios, a new exhaust\nwith round tailpipes and flap valve, an enhanced\nF1-style, 3-element stepped rear diffuser, an\noil/water heat exchanger, a larger radiator with\ntwin fans and sleek new lightweight polished\nnickel finish, 8-spoke heat treated road wheels.\n208"

The standard Elise intake manifold was\nreplaced by a cast alloy version as used on the\n111S. Alongside a reprogrammed ECU, these\nmodifications further improved the Elise’s ‘engine\nbreathing,’ allowing the driver to fully explore\nmaximum engine revs in all gears, and increasing\ndriver enjoyment, especially during events such\nas the fast growing track-day scene.\nDeveloped by Lotus Sport and Performance in\nconjunction with the Lotus Ride and Handling\nteam, the Lotus Sport Elise 135R was designed to\nprovide ultimate performance both on and off the\ntrack. Engine, suspension, wheel and tyre upgrades\nall contribute to what could only be described as the\nultimate road and track Elise. Offering a more direct\nfeel, the 135R afforded the enthusiast driver with\nmore immediate and sharper responses, developed\nto deliver exceptional driver involvement.\nWith an ever increasing number of Lotus owners\ndemanding more of their cars, Lotus set out to\ncreate an Elise that would exceed all expectations.\nThe Lotus Ride and Handling team developed a\nsports suspension set-up that gave its user total\ncontrol over ride height settings to maximise the car’s\nperformance. The Elise’s Bilstein dampers were re-\ncalibrated to give stiffer bump and rebound settings,\nand the dampers were also fitted with adjustable\nupper spring platforms threaded onto the damper\nitself, offering a wide range of settings for any use.\nA stiffer ‘Motorsport’ adjustable anti-roll bar\nwas also fitted to provide optimum steering response.\nFollowing on from this, Lotus Sport & Performance\nredesigned the flow characteristics of the cylinder\nhead specifically for the 135R to offer greater\nflexibility throughout the rev range.\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nSport Elise 135R\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2003-04\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n126\nENGINE TYPE\nMG Rover K-Series\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/135bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149in/67.5in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n1667lb/756kg\nThe 135R was fitted with O.Z. one-piece lightweight cast alloy 16-spoke\nwheels, and while the rear wheel size remained unchanged, the front wheel size\nwas increased from 5.5 to 6.5-inches to give a more positive turn-in under track\nconditions. Externally, the 135R was recognisable by its unique colour and\ndecals. 2003 MY 135Rs were only available in two colours, Silver Mirage\n(50 cars) and Blue Mica (51 cars), but for the MY2004, 25 Saffron Yellow cars\nwere built. The bespoke interior was limited to the 135R only and included an\ninstrument binnacle and column cowlings trimmed in blue Alcantara – as\nwere the seats — all set off with additional carbon leather trim with unique\nembroidery and blue footwell carpets embroidered with the 135R logo.

        "content": "Unpowered soapboxes had been racing down the famous hillclimb course at the\nGoodwood Festival of Speed since 2000, and an entry in the 2002 event was an ideal\nopportunity for graduates to represent Lotus in the competition. The first Lotus soapbox,\ndesignated as the Type 119, was entered in the open-topped ‘roadster’ class, rather than\nthe more challenging closed-cockpit ‘streamliner’ class.\nLed by David Stacey, the team was granted access to the extensive facilities at Lotus’\nHethel site, but it could only work outside working hours, and within the regulations’\nbudget. Support would eventually be required from over 150 Lotus employees, from\nmetalwork fabricators to CAD modellers, from Lotus Design stylists to buyers. The\nteam also brought in sponsors to supply hi-tech materials in return for logo placement\non the vehicle.\n2002\nTowards the end of 2001 the Group Lotus board\ngave approval for a team of young engineers on\nthe company’s Graduate Scheme to enter the\nprestigious ‘Goodwood Gravity Racing Club\nSoapbox Challenge’, paving the way for what\nwas to become an annual graduate project.\nTo ensure a super smooth aerodynamic profile, the\nadvanced carbon composite monocoque chassis was\ndesigned using the latest Computer-Aided Engineering\n(CAE) software, while ultra low-resistance bearings\nensured that the 18.5-inch wheels spun as freely as\nwas possible.\nThe 119’s neatest trick, though, was its clever Active\nMass Distribution (AMD) system that shifted lead ballast\nlaterally to the side of the soapbox on the inside of the\ncorner. This optimised the weight distribution to produce\nmore grip, resulting in faster cornering. It was ingenious\nand pilot Paul Adams claimed that at high speed he could\ngently steer the soapbox using only the AMD.\nAfter the nine-month programme though, glory\neluded the Type 119 at Goodwood 2002. Over the two\nruns, Adams piloted the Type 119 to second in class and\nthird overall behind BMW’s Project Rolls Royce roadster\nand McLaren’s streamliner. It was, however, a gallant\ndebut in a field of 26 competitors.\nThe following year, five newly employed graduates\ntook up the Goodwood challenge with the Type 119B\nroadster. James Setter led the team and believed victory\nwould result from achieving the minimum possible\naerodynamic and rolling resistance, so a brand new\nmonocoque chassis design was penned.\nMany of the sponsors were retained for 2003’s\nassault and the majority of the materials and component\nsolutions were identical. The team now had access to a\nwind tunnel, and used it to refine the 119B’s profile, while\nlightweight titanium steering components borrowed from\nFormula 1 helped improve the steering.\nLarger 26-inch Mavic wheels were expected to\nmaximise the top speed, and enclosing them would\nfurther reduce drag. Top spec wheel hubs and bearings\nkept rolling resistance to an absolute minimum while\nhigh quality tyres offered optimal levels of grip for the\nhighspeed bends of the Goodwood hill. Lotus Design set\nto work on the rather conservative styling of the previous\nyear’s Type 119, and produced an attention-seeking\nall-yellow colour scheme for the all new Type 119B.\nPilot Malcolm Barnett skillfully drove the 119B to win\nthe roadster class, also bringing home the Best Presented\nRoadster award, a tribute to the efforts of Lotus Design.\n2003\n2004\nDownhill Racer\nType 119\nDownhill Racer\nType 119B\nDownhill Racer\nType 119C\nThird overall was a little disappointing, though, especially\nas confusion on the start-line had cost Barnett a good\nfew seconds: in the spirit of the competition though,\nno official complaint was lodged.\nThe six strong Type 119C team of 2004 was led by\nKrisada “Mick” Kritayakirana. For the first time, the\nteam had a commercial graduate to manage sponsorship\nand promotional work, allowing the engineers to focus\nentirely on the technical hurdles.\nThe challenge was significant as the team decided to\nswitch to the closed-cockpit ‘streamliner’ class. Although\nmore aerodynamically efficient and promising a greater\nchance of overall victory, streamliners faced far more\ncomplex safety regulations.\nThe all-new Lotus Type 119C sported a sweeping\ncanopy and a unique ‘cab-forward’ design; not beautiful,\nbut conceived for absolute aerodynamic efficiency.\nThe team had actually scanned the pilot’s body and\nprogrammed the results into their design parameters to\nensure that the bodywork fitted him as tightly as possible.\nLow friction bearings and smaller,16-inch, anodized\naluminium 36-spoke wheels were set up to once again\noffer the absolute minimum of rolling resistance.\nFormula 1 technology was again employed in the carbon\ncomposite monocoque as well as the new tungsten\nballast, and the bespoke titanium steering components.\nThe team pursued a comprehensive testing\nprogramme intended to give returning Type 119 pilot\nPaul Adams more experience with the soapbox’s dynamic\nattributes. This extra time in the cockpit served him well.\nThe 2004 competition started sensationally as Adams\nsmashed the 2002 course record by a full second in the\npractice session, his nearest rival finishing eight seconds\nadrift! Despite a wet first competitive run producing\nslower times, Adams piloted superbly in the second run,\nbreaking his own record, and reaching speeds of over\n63mph. Under severe pressure to make up time, one after\nanother of Lotus’ rivals crashed out at the final high-speed\nMolcombe Corner, and the marshals were forced to halt\nthe day’s racing after only six of the 22 entrants had run.\nLotus took overall victory, with Bentley second, and the\nB.A.R. F1 team third.\n210"

This exercise increased assembled quality\nand allowed line workers to comment on awkward tasks,\nwhich could inflate build times to uneconomical levels.\nLotus decided to upgrade the Elise to include fully\nintegrated 21st century safety features, incorporating\nanti-lock brakes and for the USA, dual air-bags – air-bags\nwere still not part of the initial ’04 European Elise\nspecification, whatever the engine.\nIn the Autumn of 2003 Lotus previewed the VVTL-i\nengined 2005 Model Year US Elise, and 2004 European\n111R-badged Toyota powertrain uprates, the Toyota\nengine and 6-speed transaxle, both of which were\navailable for selected press drives. The first production\nunits hit the showrooms in February (Europe) and July\n(USA) of 2004.\nInitially available in the UK at a price of £27,995\nand soon throughout the world, the new model now\nfeatured a full 4-channel ABS anti-lock braking system.\nIt modulated the hydraulic pressure in the AP Racing\ntwin piston front calipers and single piston Brembo rears,\nboth clamping 282mm discs. These discs were far from\nthe original Series 1 cars’ Metal Matrix flyweights, but in\nassociation with the anti-lock system which was tuned for\nlate intervention, the 26mm thick cross-drilled iron units\nup front certainly did a fine job.\nThis was a system that really was track-tuned to give\nthe purest driving experience, although servo-assistance\nwas now part of the specification, unlike the unassisted\noriginal. Elise 111R development manager Nick Adams\nsaid, “The ABS hardware was supplied by TRW but we\ndeveloped Lotus software to run with the same TRW\nmechanical actuation as that of the GM VX220s/\nSpeedsters. We wanted our own late intervention ABS\nsettings, not the understandable big corporation ABS\nresponses for the bulk of unskilled drivers, which mean\nABS action at the first sign of trouble.”\nThe Elise-destined Toyota VVTL-i branded motor\nfeatured both variable valve timing and lift, with its\nprimary structures being in Metal Matrix Composites\n(MMC) and aluminium. The valve timing boasted\ntransient changing points, kicking in at 6200rpm and out\nat any point down to 5800rpm, depending on engine\nload as decided by the engine management control unit.\nAccording to reports, it weighed 36kg/79lb more than the\nEuropean spec 156bhp K-Series (also with variable valve\ntiming). Such an emissions-conscious power bonus and\nToyota’s quality/durability reputation around the world\n(particularly in America) certainly offset the extra weight.\nLotus quoted 189bhp in Europe or 190bhp in the\nUSA (the difference purely down to the way in which\nfigures are measured) at 7800rpm with a transient\n8500rpm redline plus an unchanged (from Toyota’s\nfigures) 133lb/ft torque by 6800rpm. Engineers for the\nLotus T4 engine management system (EMS) reported\nthat, “the software for the EMS was designed and\ndeveloped by Lotus specifically for the Elise 111R. All\ncalibration and validation work was undertaken solely\nby Lotus engineers.” The company also designed and\ndeveloped their own gearshift mechanism, which\ndelivered the old familiar Lotus snick-solid mechanical\naction that had been absent in the K-Series’ 5-speed\nElise transaxles.\nLotus Engineering stated that, “The 111R has a\nweight increase over European K-Series 111S of 3.1\npercent, and a power increase of 18.5 percent (unladen,\nno options).” To compare, those figures translated to\n825kg/1815lb for the 111S versus 860kg/1892lb for the\n111R without options, also inviting the comparison back\nto 713kg/1569lb for the Series 1 in 1996 with similarly\nbare production trim.\nThe Toyota generation featured subtle but significant\nsuspension differences. Rack and pinion steering was\nrated an official 2.8 turns lock to lock without assistance,\nslightly more than the original S1. The S2 suspension\nMilestone Car\nformat of unequal length wishbones, Bilstein mono-tube gas damper and Eibach\ncoaxial coil spring at each corner, plus a front anti-roll bar, remained, albeit retuned\naround rates higher by a substantial 20 percent over the European K-Series S2. The\nbiggest handling change, however, resulted from the adoption of a redesigned lightweight\nsteel subframe that significantly increased rear end rigidity and allowed for further fine\ntuning of the suspension.\nThe European 111R was developed around the unequally sized Bridgestone Potenza\nRE040 in 175/55-16 front and 225/45-17 rears, sharing wheel dimensions and 8-spoke\nstyle with the standard American Elise, but not the tyre manufacturer.\n"

        "content": "Although the second edition Exige shared the second generation Elise’s Toyota\ntechnology, its radical styling and track bias led to a hardcore circuit character, albeit\none that could be civilised considerably over the original.\nThe second iteration of Exige – the hardcore hardtop Elise variant – shared\na mid-mounted 189bhp Toyota motor and 6-speed gearbox, but styling changes\nwere comprehensive compared to the contemporary Elise. The Exige’s formula car\naerodynamics were also distinctive, as was an individually tuned chassis on Lotus\ntailored Yokohama 048 rubber, all adding to its wild circuit refugee character.\n2004\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige S2\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2004-07\nEXAMPLES BUILT\napprox. 2,900\nENGINE TYPE\nToyota VVTL-i 16v\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/189bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149.5in/68in/45.5in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n1929lb/875kg\nAfter a two year absence from the\nmarketplace, Lotus re-introduced the Lotus\nExige – a car that, despite being on sale for just\nover one year, had revolutionised the hardcore\nsports coupé market. The second generation\nExige, unveiled at the Geneva Motorshow in 2004,\ntook that same racecar-for-the-road philosophy\nand applied it to the new generation Elise.\nAt £29,995 the new Exige was over £2000 less than\npredicted when the media were allowed to first see the car\nat the prototype launch in Autumn 2003. Yet the option\nlist contained some necessary equipment for road or track\nuse that most British buyers would be unlikely to ignore.\nMost importantly, an effective air conditioning system –\nfor a street car a feature that most experienced Exige\ndrivers specified, even in the comparative cool of Great\nBritain – was offered at £1295 Lotus recognised that air\nconditioning was vital in some markets, and it was\nincluded in retail price for all the Asia-Pacific markets,\nspecifically Japan and Australia. The Exige though\nwas not officially available in the USA at this time.\nThese 2004 charges were much more realistic than\nthe original 2000 Exige, which some felt had been rather\nsteeply priced at £32,995 with just the 177bhp K-series\npowerplant. However, the first Exige has quickly become\na collectable classic, and 3-4 year old examples were still\nvery much in demand at main dealers when the second\nedition arrived in Britain.\nThe dramatic styling and ultimate (cornering) speed\nowed much to the creativity of Lotus Design’s Steve\nCrijns under the direction of Russell Carr, along with\nsome serious wind tunnel work. Crijns also deserves credit\nfor a functional reappraisal of his S2 Elise handiwork:\nsmoother and wider front air intakes, emphasised wheel\narches and a vented engine compartment made possible\nby a new rear clamshell that also deleted fake vents\naround the tail lights. One side effect was to deliver a\nformal boot area for the Exige, now much more accessible\nthan previously, as the lowered rear wing was integrated\nwith the engine cover hatch.\nObvious aerodynamic work appeared in a tail plane\nthat crouched on the back deck and fixed at an 11.5-degree\nrake, to optimally balance drag and downforce. The\nextended front spoiler splitter with ground clearance set at\n108mm and the black anodised rear diffuser underline the\nserious treatment given to under body aerodynamics, with\nthe Elise particularly suited to flat floor techniques. Extra\nfront air ducts (serving optional oil coolers) were\ncomplemented by brake cooling ducts, the latter located\nbehind the front wheels. Large side air intakes and a roof\nExige Series 2\nType 111\nscoop provided “much needed air to circulate around\nthe engine bay,” asserted Lotus, and all the grilles,\nincluding the rear engine cover, were covered in a\nlightweight steel mesh.\nLotus reported the aerodynamics created 41.2kg of\ndown force at 160kph. The downforce ratio between\nfront (47 per cent) and rear (53 per cent) was of course\nbalanced and remained constant at the speeds of which\nthe Exige was capable. At 100mph some 90lb of\ndownward thrust was claimed, certainly good for a car\nwith public road abilities and a key factor in its astounding\ntrack speed. The 048LTS Lotus-tuned version of the\nrespected Yokohama 048R tyre now came in a wider\nElise format, with 195/50R16 on the front and\n225/45R17 at the rear.\nPerformance figures for Exige reflected that weight\nwas up – the heaviest Elise variant could creep up to\n916kg with options like 15kg air conditioning included.\nThe lowest weight you could expect from Exige-Toyota\nwas 875kg, compared to 780kg of the original in 177bhp\ntrim. Thus 0-60mph for the newcomer was only claimed\nto be a little under the 5 second barrier (actually 0.2 sec\nslower than the first Exige), with 0-100mph rated by\nLotus in 13.2 seconds versus the 12.6 seconds of the\nfirst flyweight. The maximum speed claim of 147mph\nfor the newcomer was 11mph higher than the factory’s\nclaim for the S1 Exige.\nVital features from the Toyota Elise were retained,\nincluding ABS braking and the 4.53:1 final drive on the\n16 and 17-inch diameter wheel sizes. Earlier Elise\nprinciples of the epoxy-bonded aluminium chassis with\nsteel sections were still utilised along with the Elise-\nToyota redesigned rear subframe and integral seat belt\nattachments. Unequal length wishbone suspension arms\nand extruded substructures were incorporated, as before.\nHowever most of the Exige’s body panels were new,\nmanufactured in GRC (Glass Reinforced Composite).\nStandard equipment for the Exige in UK included\na Blaupunkt Lausanne radio/CD player and speakers,\nauxiliary front driving lights and central door locking.\nAll the signs pointed to an outstanding circuit star\nwith everyday road capabilities.\n214"

These were to\nbe produced by the Lotus Sport workshops as post-\nregistration, official factory conversions of the standard\n2006 Exige model.\nThe main visual difference compared to the previous\nyear’s 240R model included the fitting of the standard\nExige wheels, now in ‘Hi-power’ silver, as well as the usual\nrace car fittings which included an FIA 6-point roll cage,\nas well as a remote kill switch and fire extinguisher system\nrelease on the outside of the left-hand rear buttress.\nLotus Sport, the motor sport division of Lotus Cars\nLtd., developed these two higher performance versions\nof the 2006 Model Year Lotus Exige, designated the\nLotus Exige Cup 190 and the Lotus Exige Cup 240, for\ntrack (and road) use straight out of the box.\nBoth versions were built as official factory conversions\nof the regular Exige by Lotus Sport at its facilities alongside\nthe test track at Group Lotus Headquarters in Hethel,\nNorfolk, and each car featured a Lotus Sport build plate.\nConstructed around the basic ’06 Exige, both cars\nwere completely track ready sports coupés but featured an\nuprated clutch (with sports-type clutch plate and heavy\nduty clutch cover), sports exhaust, adjustable suspension,\nuprated brakes, limited slip differential, switchable\ntraction control, a T45 steel roll-over hoop and A-frame\nwith harness mounts, the aforementioned fuel and\nignition kill switches, and a fully plumbed in fire\nextinguisher system. All these items, as well as the FIA\napproved 6-point roll cage were fitted as a no cost option.\nAs the names suggested, the Lotus Exige Cup cars\nwere available with two different engine variants. The\nLotus Exige Cup 190 used the all-aluminium 189bhp\n(181Nm) normally aspirated four-cylinder 1.8-litre 2ZZ\nVVTL-i engine, and the Exige Cup 240 used an uprated\nsupercharged and intercooled higher revving version of\nthe same engine, producing 243bhp at 8000rpm, with\na torque figure of 236Nm at 7000rpm.\nPerformance from both the variants was certainly\nphenomenal, with the Lotus Exige Cup 190 reaching\n60mph (100kph) in 5.2 seconds and 100mph (160kph)\nin 13.2 seconds, with a top speed of 147mph (237kph).\nThe more powerful Exige Cup 240 with its Roots-type\nsupercharger reached the 60mph mark in just under\n4.5 seconds and 100mph in 11.3 seconds. Top speed\nwas 155mph (249kph).\nApart from the differences in engine performance,\nthe two new Lotus Exige Cup cars had nearly identical\nspecification, with the now familiar Toyota sourced C64\n6-speed manual gearbox driving the rear wheels via the\nusual Elise/Exige double wishbone suspension set-up that\non the Cup cars featured Öhlins springs and two-way\nadjustable dampers. One addition to the two Cup cars\nwas the fitting of a double- shear track control arm brace\nthat gave added stability on hard track-day driving. The\nY-type 8-spoke lightweight alloy wheels were fitted with\nYokohama Advan A048 tyres all round.\nTucked inside the stylish silver wheels the improved\nbrake system included cross-drilled and ventilated discs,\nas well as uprated sports brake pads set in the calipers\n(AP Racing at the front and Brembo at the rear). Even\nwith the additional engine supercharging system fitted,\nthe Cup 240 still only weighed in at a fraction over 2000lb (930kg) and gave a power\nto weight ratio of more than 277bhp per tonne.\nA Level One stainless steel sports exhaust was also fitted, with the exhaust pipes\nexiting from the centre of the anodised-finish 3-piece rear diffuser.

The Exige S was not a limited edition, nor was it an aftermarket special –\nit was manufactured from start to finish in the new and improved world leading and\naward winning Lotus Manufacturing facility at Hethel.\nBecause the basic car was so immensely strong but lightweight (935kg, 2061lb) –\ngiving a power to weight ratio of 173.8kW/tonne (233.2bhp/tonne, 236.4) –\nperformance was certainly phenomenal, with 100kph being reached from a standing\nstart in 4.3 seconds (0-60mph in 4.1 seconds) and 160kph (100mph) being reached in\n9.98 seconds, before topping out at 238kph (148mph). Inspite of this phenomenal\nperformance, the fuel economy was impressive with an official combined figure of\nExige S\nType 111\n9.1 litres/100 km (31.0 mpg) quoted. Lotus believed and\npromoted the fact that there was no car on sale anywhere\nin the world that had such good performance combined\nwith such good fuel economy. Not that many customers\nwere buying this car principally for its fuel economy!\nBeing a Lotus, straight-line performance was not the\nmost important factor, but every day driving on normal\nroads, or around a circuit was. There were very few cars\non sale in 2006 that could match the speed, agility and\nsafety of the Exige S in both day to day and/or track\ndriving. However the Exige S was not just a track day\nspecial, it was a sportscar that would be at home on the\nback roads, motorways, freeways and autobahns of the\nworld, as well as on city streets. With an extremely\n‘torquey’ engine and the classic Lotus suspension\nset-up, the driving experience was once again a perfect\ncombination of telepathic-like handling with a taught\nand comfortable ride.\nAt the end of 2006 Lotus announced the Exige S\nBritish GT Special Edition based on the Exige S. The\ncar replicated the black/silve/yellow race colours of the\n#019 car raced by Lotus Sport Cadena that had won the\n2006 British GT3 Team Championship (see p219). Each\nof the 72 cars built featured the quad-stripe paint scheme\nand was individually identified unique numbered ‘British\nGT’ Badges, Lotus Sport Cadena supplier decals and\nsilver versions of the the 7 twin-spoke forged alloy wheels\nas on the standard road car. Unique sports seats, door\ntrims and Lotus Sport floor carpets completed the\n‘racecar’ feel."

The orange 271bhp machine was a\nbold, breathtaking, no-holds-barred, lap record-breaking,\nperformance machine that embraced all that was\nexpected of a race-bred Lotus. Building on the Lotus\nracing pedigree, this concept car would certainly deliver\nmore grin-factor than ever before. Taking over the mantle\nfrom the hugely successful 2006 British GT3\nChampionship winning car, the new Exige GT3’s racing\nedition was set to compete in the 2007 GT race arena,\nand continued time honoured Lotus racing tradition on\nroad and track. It was intended that the Lotus Exige GT3\nconcept road vehicle would be further developed into a\nfull production car for limited markets and go on sale in\nlate 2007 with an estimated price tag of between\n£50,000 and £60,000.\nWith a new one-piece front clam-shell with fully\nmasked front wheels and wheel arch venting, the new\nGT3 presented an aerodynamically cleaned silhouette,\nand its menacing stance was enhanced by the aggressively\nflared rear wheel arches and aero-efficient three\ndimensional rear wing and blended end-plates. The visual\nmessage was clear; this vehicle meant business.\nPower was provided by the same charge-cooled\nsupercharged engine that the ’06 GT3 race car employed,\nproducing 275PS (271bhp/203kw) driven through ten\ninch rear wheels with 255 width tyres making the final\nconnection to the road.

This significant amount\nof extra power and torque available, together with the\nVVTL-i variable cam system ensured that there was\na smooth and linear surge of power from low engine\nspeeds all the way to the maximum 8000rpm.\nLotus designed the lightweight structure of epoxy\nbonded aluminium alloy extrusions with composite crash\nstructure, extruded aluminium door beams, an integral\nsteel seat-belt support structure and a galvanized steel\nrear sub frame incorporating a structural shear panel.\nThe external appearance was distinguished by the\naforementioned GT3-derived one-piece front clamshell\nand wide-track rear clamshell with full length roof scoop\ndesign. A new highly efficient full width three-dimensional\nrear wing was mounted to rear clam complemented the\nwidened and flattened rear deck shape in reducing the\noverall drag, as well as maintaining front to rear\ndownforce balance.

With increased levels of both\npracticality and refinement in comparison to the\nsimplicity of the Elise and Exige models, Lotus\ncreated a “More Luxury” driving experience.\nBased on the Lotus Small Platform chassis, the Europa S\nwas however, not a derivative of the Elise or the Exige\nand following a two-year plus, development program,\nwas, allocated a new Lotus Type number of 121.\nSeen by project manager Tony Shute as a slightly\nlarger and more comfortable almost-GT-style car but\nstill extreme, the Europa was built to include creature\ncomforts such as satellite navigation and leather trim. The\nEuropa S however still followed the core Lotus philosophy\nof performance through light-weight which enabled this\nrefined and high performing GT car to weigh in at just\n995kg. This low weight was obtained through the clever\nuse of advanced and high tech materials including the\nnow familiar extruded and bonded aluminium chassis,\ncomposite body panels and a very advanced composite\nenergy absorbing front crash structure.\nAs all Elise drivers know, extricating yourself from an\nElise/Exige with the roof is in place can be difficult and,\nsince Lotus envisioned a wider audience for the Europa S,\nto make getting in and out easier, the car was designed\nwith both a lower sill as well as a slightly higher roof than\nthe Elise. This gave an extra 55mm height in the door\naperture, which may not have seemed a lot, but certainly\nprovided occupants with much improved access.\nLike the Elise, the Europa featured a lightweight\nextruded aluminium chassis which weighed only 150lbs\n(68kg), and with an overall weight of just under 2200lbs,\nthe car was only about 10 percent heavier than the\ncurrent versions of the Elise.\nPower for the Europa came from the 197bhp,\n2.0-litre turbocharged Ecotec Z20LER engine sourced\nfrom the GM (Europe) inventory, which, when mated to\nthe aluminium M32 gearbox from the Vauxhall Astra\nVXR, gave a 0-60mph time of just under 5.5 seconds\nand a top speed tipping 140mph.\nUnveiled to the public at the 2006 Geneva Salon in\nMarch, the Europa S introduced enhanced levels of\npracticality and refinement to new customers of the Lotus\nbrand, and the Luxury Touring Pack Option available\nfrom April 2007 (at a price of £1,250 in the UK and\n£1,750 in Europe), stretched the Europa S even further\ntowards the more luxurious end of the spectrum. The\nLuxury Touring Pack option dressed the interior in the\nsmart attire of saddle tan and chocolate coloured leather\nwith brown carpets. Where the standard Europa S used\nlightweight composite components for items such as\nthe steering column shroud, dash top, instrument and\nventilation binnacles and sill covers, the Luxury Touring\nPack option covered these and other components with\nfour coloured leathers.\nThe supportive sports seats were also clad in leather\nin a stripe pattern. Safety-critical composite components\nsuch as the passenger airbag door were coated in a high\ntech soft-to-the-touch material. An engine start button\nand a solid Walnut and Tulip wood gear lever finished off\nthe interior package. The Luxury Touring Pack option\nalso stretched to the boot, with brown carpet covering the\nboot area, including the battery cover, a leather trimmed\ntailgate inner, luggage straps to prevent luggage from\nmoving in the boot, and a leather oddment bag fixed to\nthe boot compartment. When compared to the Elise,\nthe Europa S had a significantly larger boot/luggage\ncompartment under the large glass covered tailgate.\nExterior additions to the Luxury Touring Pack Option\nincluded tinted rear and rear three-quarter glass, body\ncoloured front driving lamp surrounds, side air-intake\nsurrounds and roof air-outlet grill. All other exterior\ngrilles such as the front radiator grilles and the rear\nlight grille surrounds were finished in silver.\nAll these luxuries added very little weight to the\nfeather-light Europa S, so spirited drivers were not\npenalised by opting for the Luxury Touring Pack.\nUnfortunately, due to emissions regulations, Lotus\nweren’t able to export the Europa S to the USA.\nEuropa S\nType 121\n224"

Previously they were only available as part of the\nSuper Touring option package.\nThe new instrument pack in the Elise SC contained\na pair of new stylishly back-lit dials and also featured\na high-definition LCD message panel that could display\na scrolling text message with vehicle systems information.\nThe new instrument pack displayed the fuel gauge,\nengine temperature and odometer, as well as the option\nto display the time, trip distance or a digital readout of\nyour speed in the opposite calibration to that of your\nspeedometer dial – if your dial was in mph, the readout\nwas in km/h.\nIn response to forthcoming UK legislation, the Elise\nand Exige were both now fitted with a “Thatcham\napproved” alarm/immobiliser system and this enabled\na new Lotus key design that incorporated the controls\nfor the alarm/immobiliser and central locking functions.\nWith airbags now fitted as standard across the\nElise and Exige range, the number of trim option\nElise SC\nType 111\nThe biggest news on the 2008 Lotus line-up\nwas the introduction of the Supercharged Elise\nSC, easily identified by its new rear spoiler and\nunique new design of alloy road wheels, where\nthe rears were also increased half an inch in\nwidth, up to 8.0-inches in size.\npackages available was cut from four down to two. The\nprevious Super Touring and Super Sport packages\nwere dropped, and the revised Touring pack, for both\nElise and Exige, now included: full leather or microfibre\nsuede-effect interior, leather trimmed centre console,\nleather handbrake gaiter, sound system i-Pod connection,\nfull carpets (with embroidered logo), auxiliary driving\nlights, sound insulation kit and last but not least,\na cup holder!\nThe Elise Sport pack, available on the SC included:\nBilstein sports dampers, traction control, twin oil coolers,\nProBax Sport seats, Hi-Power silver lightweight forged\nwheels with standard AD07 tyres. The beauty of the\nTouring and Sport packs was that they could be\ncombined so a customer could have the additional interior\nand exterior equipment from the Touring pack with the\nsport focused equipment from the Sport pack.\nAir conditioning, Lotus traction control, limited slip\ndifferential and hardtop were available as stand-alone\noptions, and customers wanting to add further finishing\ntouches to their Lotus were still able to order from an\nextensive range of accessories. As part of the 2008 Model\nYear enhancements, the Elise, Exige and Europa paint\nranges were revised, with some less popular shades being\ndropped and new colours, including some vibrant\npearlescent colours, being introduced.\n2008 also saw a number of Limited Edition SC\nmodels released. These included a 60th Anniversary\nEdition available to the US market only as well as 25\nexamples of a Jim Clark (Type 25) Edition (below) in the\nproverbial ‘Green and Yellow’ of course. These 25 cars\nwere to celebrate both the Type 25 Clark drove to World\nChampionship glory as well as his career total of 25\nGrand Prix wins.\nDespite the on-paper similarity with the Exige S, this was no mere engine swap –\nthis was an all-new, non-intercooled installation applied to the then current Elise’s\n1.8-litre 2-ZZ VVTL-i engine.\nThe Lotus-designed, Magnuson-produced supercharger used a\nsmaller Eaton rotor pack (an M45 unit) than that of the Exige S,\nand was married to the intake manifold plenum as part of\na single-piece casting. Combined with the absence\nof an intercooler and its associated\npipework, this integrated\nsupercharger/intake assembly\ncontributed to an 8kg reduction\nin engine weight compared with\nthe Exige S.\nA further benefit of dispensing\nwith the intercooler for the Elise SC\napplication was the supercharger\npackaging viability for Elise and\nimproved rear visibility when\nadopted into the Exige S, where\nvision from the rear view mirror\nwas masked by the intercooler\ninstallation.\nThe Elise SC was designed to\nhave different driving characteristics\nthan the Exige S.

        "content": "The 2008 Lotus Sport Exige Cup 260 was a direct\ndevelopment of the 2006-7 Exige Cup 255, with a\nrevised engine management system to take the maximum\npower output to 257bhp, up by nearly 5bhp. Bespoke\nperformance enhancements were developed to offer a car\nwith even greater levels of handling and acceleration\ncapable of taming Europe’s most challenging race circuits.\nIn traditional Lotus style, weight saving was\nparamount. Weighing in at just 928kg, the power to\nweight ratio is an impressive 271bhp/tonne. Such a\nfantastic power to weight ratio alone of course does not\nmake a superlative track car, so the Exige Cup 260 had a\nformidable list of standard equipment that included Lotus\nspecific LTS compound Yokohama A048R tyres, 4-piston\nAP Racing front brake calipers, adjustable dampers and\nanti-roll bar. The car could also be ordered as a Track\nVersion for track use only. This variant came pre-fitted\nwith an FIA approved 6-point roll cage, and 4-point\nharnesses, and had a wide range of motorsport specific\noptions available.\nThe Lotus Sport Exige Cup 260 was one of the\nquickest cars around any given circuit, and key to this\nincredible performance was the aerodynamic package,\nwhich produced over 40kg of downforce at 100mph,\nincreasing grip and stability at higher speeds. With a\ntop speed of 147mph and a 0-100mph in 9.9 seconds,\n0-60mph in 4 seconds, the 2008 Exige Cup 260 was\nnot for the faint hearted.\nMike Kimberley, Chief Executive Officer Group\nLotus plc said: “In keeping with our racing and high\nperformance sports car heritage, we are very pleased to\nlaunch this exceptionally exciting, phenomenal-handling\nLotus Sport Exige Cup 260. This is yet another example\nof how Lotus Cars and high-tech engineering with Lotus\nSport, can transform an already brilliant road car into an\nexceptionally high performance product for the track.”\nThe supercharged and inter-cooled engine had a\ntorque figure of 236Nm (174lbft) at 6000rpm, and this\nsignificant amount of extra power and torque now\navailable, together with the VVTL-i variable cam system\nensured a smooth and linear surge of power from low\nengine speeds all the way to the maximum 8000rpm. The\nRoots-type EatonM62 Supercharger was run from the\ncrankshaft and was fitted with an integral bypass valve\nfor part load operation. Charge air (air under pressure\nfrom the Supercharger) was cooled through an air-to-air\nintercooler before being fed into the engine itself. All\ncharge air ducting was kept as short as possible, with large\ndiameter pipes to minimise restriction and maximise\nthrottle response and efficiency. Four high capacity\ninjectors and an uprated fuel pump were designed to add\nadditional fuel under hard acceleration or continuous\nhigh speed driving.\nThe Sport Exige Cup 260 retained the full length roof scoop from the outgoing Sport\nExige Cup 255, which improved the intake ambient air flow rate, so allowing the Exige\nCup 260 to gain a higher charge density in the cylinders.\nA sports-type clutch plate and heavy duty clutch cover transferred the engine power\nand torque to the lightweight C64 six-speed gearbox (with an aluminium casing) - with\nthe same ratios as the Exige S. A Torsen type limited slip differential was fitted as\nstandard, but a plate type limited slip differential was available as an option.\nThe brake system included large diameter 308mm, 2-piece aluminium belled cast\niron cross-drilled and ventilated front discs and 282mm cross-drilled and ventilated discs\nat the rear, upgraded Pagid RS14 sports brake pads set into the brake calipers (AP\nRacing two piece radially mounted, 4-piston at the front and Brembo sliding at the rear),\nhigh grade silicone brake fluid and stainless steel braided brake hoses – all linked to the\nproven Lotus track tuned servo-assisted four-channel ABS system that enhanced braking\nperformance and minimized stopping distance.\nAdjustable dampers and a stiffened and adjustable front anti-roll bar allow the driver\nto tailor the handling characteristics of the car to their own requirements. As the Lotus\nSport Exige Cup 260 cars were equipped for track use, a double shear track control arm\nbrace was again fitted.\nSport Exige Cup 260\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nSport Exige Cup 260\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2008-09\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n300\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged Toyota VVTL-i 16v\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/257bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149.5in/68in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n2046lb/928kg\n"

A blend of\navant-garde styling and ingenious engineering\nfrom Lotus Cars, the Evora shared the bonded\naluminium technology pioneered on the Elise\n(unbelievably now 14-years-old), but was built\nin three independent modules comprising a\ncentral tub and sections for the front and rear.\n2008\nAlthough it shared its name with the ancient city\nof Évora, a World Heritage site about an hour-\nand-a-half east of Lisbon, the name Evora was\ncreated by Lotus and derived from the words\n“Evolution, Vogue and Aura.” The Evora’s\ngestation was rapid by any standard. The initial\nsketches were penned in August 2006, and the first\nprototypes were being tested in early 2008. The\ndisguises came off the prototypes after the\nunveiling in July 2008, VP (verification prototypes)\nwere being made in October and the first cars\nwere scheduled for build in December of 2008.\nThe first 16 production cars were earmarked as\ntest mules to develop a federal version, with a\nview to productionising the US car in October 2009.\nRevealed to the public at the 2008 British Motor\nShow in London, the Evora had a sports-\norientated suspension set-up, employing\nwishbones that were as light as those on the Elise\nbut twice as stiff and, as a result, very expensive\nto develop. Despite the fact that the Evora was\nlonger than the Elises, the intention was always\nthat it should provide the same superb Lotus\nhandling. The Elise was a familiar enough model\nto provide intelligible contrasts with the Evora, so\nwhile both wheelbase and track on the Elise were\nsignificantly shorter than the Evora, and although\nthe chassis (which weighed just 440lb) looked\nlarge, the Evora’s width was kept down by cleverly\nreducing the sill width, without compromising its\noverall strength.\nThe new car was powered by a 276bhp, 3.5-litre\nToyota-sourced V6, monitored by Lotus’s own\nengine management system, driving through\na manual six-speed Toyota gearbox. Despite\nrelatively modest power, the sub-3000lb kerb\nweight helped it to achieve a top speed\nof 162mph and a 0-60mph time of 4.9 seconds.\nDesigned in-house by the team at Lotus\nDesign, the sleek exterior was wrapped tightly\nover the mechanicals underneath, for a low\ncoefficient of drag (just 0.33). By careful\nmanagement of airflow through the front of the\ncar, balanced with a step-down roofline and an\nintegrated rear wing, the design team found the\naerodynamic downforce needed to enhance\ndriving stability and cornering performance.\nPowerful bi-xenon headlamps were on the\noptions list, as were parking sensors, a rear\nview camera and folding mirrors.\nThe more ergonomically focused Evora offered\nthe most comfortable cabin that Lotus had ever\ncreated, and it was far easier to get in and out of\nthan an Elise. Never intended as a track day car,\nEvora\nType 122\nMilestone Car\n“Looking to the future we will continue to research, develop and produce\nlighter more efficient vehicles.

Similarly, the\nsill was lower and narrower and the seat sat 65mm higher\noff the floor than in an Elise.\nThe interior echoed the lines of the exterior with a\nfloating centre console and a contrasting leather band\nrunning as a hoop from the dash right around the doors,\ncabin sides and across the rear seats. The dash was\ncovered in leather and aluminium, switches were edge-lit\nand an optional central touch-screen operated the radio,\ni-Pod/mp3 player and sat-nav controls. The Recaro front\nseats were more substantial than those in the Elise, and\nwith the extra width gave more shoulder room between\nthe driver and front seat passenger. A lever hidden in one\nof the portals at shoulder level in the seat back folded the\nseat forward to gain access to the rear.\nThe Evora took the Elise family a stage further,\nproviding an opulent cabin with two seats in the rear,\nwhile retaining the mid-engined layout for optimum\nbalance. The two-plus-two cabin provided space for a pair\nof adults in the front and two 5-footers in the back, and if\nyou didn’t want any rear seats in your Evora you could\nopt for the Plus Zero version.\nVehicle Engineering Director Roger Becker had been\nat Lotus for 42 years. “Right now is a very special time,”\nhe said. “We’ve had a bit of a dry spell for the last 13\nyears.

The\nproject displayed a range of affordable green technologies that\nwere intended to be feasible as well as production viable in the\nnear term future, and focussed on developments in sustainable\nmaterials, cleaner manufacturing processes, renewable energy\ngeneration, reducing carbon miles, efficient driving techniques,\nand of course, vehicle weight reduction.\nCapitalising on great strides forward in green technology\n,\nthe Eco Elise project promoted a different perspective on\n“green”, one which did not revolve solely around tailpipe CO2.\nThis holistic approach was keeping within the progressive\nLotus culture, driving Lotus to become the world’s green\nautomotive consultancy.\nSustainable materials, hemp, eco wool and sisal were\ndeveloped for body panels and trim, and combined with hi-tech\nwater based paint solutions, showcased new affordable green\ntechnologies. The green credentials of the technology on show\nin the Eco Elise were analysed throughout the lifecycle of the\ncar. A green gear change display was integrated into the\ndashboard to promote greener driving, as well as a weight\nreduction programme, illustrating the holistic approach\ntaken. The energy expended to manufacture the car was re-\nevaluated, working to the 3R’s - Reduce, Re-use and Recycle.\nMike Kimberley\n, CEO of Group Lotus plc commented,\n“This Eco Elise is a great example of the advanced and\naffordable green technologies Lotus have been developing.\nWe are at the cutting edge of environmental technology and\nare determined to push forward with our green agenda. The\nLotus brand values of lightweight, fuel efficient, and high\nperformance are more relevant today than they ever have been.”\nThe green materials sourced for the Eco Elise were carefully\nstudied to ensure that each reduced the environmental impact\nof the vehicle. The life of the components was analysed\nduring the production stage, in-use, and at the end of the\nvehicle’s life. The technology used aimed to offer lower\nemissions of both solvents and CO2 in the vehicle’s lifecycle,\nwith reductions in energy consumed during manufacture.\nThe renewable materials incorporated into the project\nprovided natural, biodegradable, engineering materials that\nillustrated the capability of Lotus to utilise new, advanced\nmaterials, as well as the flexibility of their manufacturing\nfacilities. Cleaner manufacturing processes were also sought,\nsuch as utilising the latest water-based paint technology\n,\nreducing emissions of solvents from the paint shop.

The research vehicle\nweighed just 930kg and was called the Lotus Exige 265E.\n265 indicated the approximate horsepower of the vehicle\nand the E indicated the environmentally favourable\nbioethanol E85 fuel (85% ethanol alcohol and 15%\npetrol) that powered the high performing car.\nKey to this performance was a slightly modified\nversion of the 2ZZ VVTL-i supercharged and intercooled\nengine as fitted to the standard Exige S. This gave\nperformance figures that would thrash the majority of\n‘Super-Unleaded’ performance cars: 0-60mph in 3.88\nseconds, 0-100mph in 9.2 seconds and a top speed of\n158mph! In fact, the Lotus Exige 265E was probably\nthe world’s quickest road-legal E85 bio-ethanol car.\nEthanol has less stored energy per unit volume than\ngasoline so the fuel economy is less, however as E85\nethanol is 85 percent sourced from renewable bio matter,\nthere is a net reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2).\nAt the 2008 Geneva Show, Lotus showcased the\neven more powerful Exige 270E Tri-fuel. With similar\nperformance figures to the 265E, but now with 270bhp\n(at 8000rpm) the 270E was capable of running on any\nmixture of gasoline, bioethanol and methanol.\nThe Tri-fuel Exige was part of Lotus’ research to\nunderstand the complex combustion process involved\nin running on mixtures of alcohol fuels and gasoline,\nsomething which will become important if there is to be\na successful transition from today’s fuels to the sustainable,\nsynthetic fuels of the future.\nProduced synthetically from CO2 and hydrogen, the\nuse of Methanol (CH3OH), combined with emerging\nprocesses to recover atmospheric CO2, will ultimately\nprovide the required carbon that can entirely balance the\nExige 265E & 270E\nType 111\nCO2 emissions resulting from the internal combustion of\nmethanol. The result is that a car running on methanol,\nsuch as the Exige 270E would be environmentally neutral.\nAs well as being green, the great benefit of synthetic\nmethanol is that it would use similar engines and fuel\nsystems to those in current cars; and synthetic methanol\ncan be stored, transported and retailed in much the same\nway as today’s liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel.\nLotus Engineering’s Lotus Exige 270E Tri-fuel\ntechnology demonstrator illustrated how easy it is for\nsynthetic methanol to be embraced over time as a future\nfuel for road transport. With its supercharged 2ZZ-GE\nVVTL-i engine, it could be the forefather of a new\ngeneration of conventionally driven cars that have the\npotential to be environmentally-neutral.\nMike Kimberley commented, “\nAt present, the motor\nindustry is seeking a route to reduce CO2 emissions just\nat the tailpipe; this focus is far too narrow. A sustainable\nalcohol such as synthetic methanol has the potential to\nreduce the overall CO2 footprint of internal combustion\nvehicles towards zero.”"

But these cars were also\nengineered for class-leading emissions (just 199g/km CO2\nfor both cars) to complement their exhilarating\nperformance (0-60mph in 4.5 seconds and 0-100km/h\nin 4.77 seconds for the Exige S); the top speed on the\nExige S climbed to 145mph.\nThe restyled front end included a larger, more angular\nair intake mouth to help funnel more air through the\nradiator. Ahead of the front wheels on either side of the\nmain aperture, two larger air intakes increased the airflow\nto the twin oil coolers, with horizontal vanes bisecting\nthem to help stabilise that airflow for further increased\ncooling efficiency.\nRussell Carr, Chief of Lotus Design, explained, “For\n2010 we have taken the already visually extreme Exige\nand given it even more visual drama. The changes we\nhave integrated into the front and rear of the Exige\nsignal an even clearer and (more) purposeful intent. The\npurposeful rear wing is race inspired, the new angular air\nintakes and full width splitter gives a more hard-edged\nand aggressive look. Overall, the Exige appears more\nplanted and gives the illusion that both the front and rear\nof the car are wider than they really are without losing\nits agile and lithe character.”\nOnce again Lotus provided customers with a range\nof Limited Edition special models of the Exige S and\nCup 260, the most distinctive of which was the matt\nblack ‘Scura’ (or Stealth in some markets), of which\njust 35 were built.\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige Cup 260\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2009-11\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n129\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged Toyota VVTL-i 16v dohc\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/257bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149.5in/68in/45in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n1962lb/890kg\nThe Exige Cup had developed a cult following and\na dedicated fan base since the first Exige Cup 240 was\nunveiled in 2006, with almost four hundred Exige Cup\ncars sold, either specifically for race and track use, or\nfor a pure road driving experience. The Exige Cup 260,\nlaunched in 2009, took the 38kg weight savings\nintroduced in the previous model, combined it with\nthe extensive body and aerodynamic improvements\nintroduced on the aforementioned 2010MY Exige S,\nand topped it all off with yet more new components and\ntechnologies to produce the most focused and pure\nExige yet built.\nRoger Becker, the Director of Vehicle Engineering\nfor Lotus said, “The Lotus Exige Cup 260 is the epitome\nof the Lotus brand philosophy of performance through\nlightweight. Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus, once\nsaid, ‘\nAdding power makes you faster on the straights;\nsubtracting weight makes you faster everywhere,’ and the\nExige Cup 260 totally proves this, being one of the most\nexhilarating, focused, and pure sportscars out there on\nthe road today.”\nFully homologated for road use in Europe and key\nmarkets in Asia and North America – a must-have for\nmany race competition programmes where a road legal\ncar has to be entered – the Exige Cup 260 was of\ncourse, also eligible to compete in the Lotus Cup\nEurope race series.\nCompared to the 2008 Exige Cup 260’s tailgate\nmounted wing, the wing on both the 2009 Exige S and\nCup 260 car was 181mm wider and mounted 46mm\nhigher and 61mm further back. It was attached to the rear\nbody clamshell via end plates which not only increased the\nstiffness of the whole structure, but also ensured that as\nExige S & Cup 260\nType 111\nmuch airflow as possible passed over the rear wing. This careful airflow management\nincreased stability, reduced drag and, most importantly, maintained the impressive\ndownforce figure of 42kg at 100mph.\nThe Cup 260 also had the restyled front end from the Exige S which included a new\nlow-hung splitter made from lightweight carbon chord composite. The splitter was\nextended to wrap around the whole of the front end and chiselled side lips were raised to\ndeflect air around the tyres to reduce drag. The rear diffuser linked the subframe to the\nmain chassis to give greatly increased lateral stiffness to the rear subframe suspension\npickup points, resulting in better tyre contact patch control.\nThis stiffness was appreciated by those drivers who raced or took part in track days\nusing the optional Yokohama A048 slick tyres that could be factory-fitted on new Lotus\nSport lightweight forged alloy wheels. Öhlin’s two-way adjustable dampers were now\nfitted as standard, for personalisation of the car’s driving characteristics, enabling drivers\nto tune the Exige Cup 260 to their driving style and road or track conditions.\nThe supercharged (Roots-type Eaton M62) and intercooled engine had a maximum\npower output of 257bhp at 8000rpm and a torque figure of 236Nm (174lbft) at\n6000rpm. The significant amount of extra power and torque now available together with\nthe VVTL-i variable cam system ensured that there was a smooth and linear delivery\nof power from low engine speeds all the way to the maximum 8000rpm. A heavy-duty\nsports-type clutch assembly transferred the engine power and torque to the lightweight\nC64 six-speed gearbox (with an aluminium casing) employing the same ratios as the\nExige S. Top speed for the Cup 260 was now 152mph and the 0-60mph time dropped\nto a fraction over 4.0 seconds. All these performance enhancements cost just £45,000.\n"

This\nweight saving was achieved by using high performance parts and materials, as well\nas deleting parts not required for motor sport.\nThe Evora racecar duo came with adjustable motor sport dampers and six-piston\nfront brake calipers, with two-piece aluminium belled brake discs. The cars also had all\nthe relevant FIA compatible motor sport equipment to race, including an electrical cut\noff, fire extinguisher and a Lotus-developed traction control system.\nClaudio Berro, Director of Motorsport at Group Lotus stated, “Lotus has an enviable\nheritage of producing very competitive racing cars and we wish to continue this heritage\nwith the Evora Cup race car. The company started by creating world beating racing cars\nand this is evident from the design of the Lotus road cars, thus the production cars have\nmany racing car design features and of course perform exceptionally well on track.”\nHe continued, “The Evora Cup racing car is the first step along the route for Lotus\nMotorsport to realise its racing ambitions. I am looking forward to seeing the Evora\nracing this year in the Lotus Evora Cup competition.”\nFollowing the announcement in 2009 that an Evora\nEndurance Racecar was to be developed (the Type 124),\njust hours after the new Evora S roadcar was shown at the\n2010 Paris Motor Show, Lotus Motorsport announced the\ntwin Evora Cup and Evora GT4 race cars. Working in\nconjunction with a number of prestigious technical\npartners, the two variations on the same concept, the Cup\nand the GT4 featured a world-class chassis, steering and\nbraking that of course resulted in exceptional handling.\nWith its capacity expanded from the standard roadcar’s\n3.5-litres, the new, naturally-aspirated 4-litre, dry sump V6\nengine was managed by a Cosworth Electronics System,\nand delivered its peak torque at 5500rpm, powering the\nrear wheels through a Cima six-speed sequential gearbox,\nfitted with a steering wheel mounted paddle shift option.\nWith FIA approved design and safety features, the car\nwas built to be accepted in over twelve of the world’s\nleading GT race series and could be easily modified for\nthe tougher demands of the longer distance endurance\nevents. In short, the Evora GT4 was a potent force and\nan ideal instrument for any level of driver to make a mark\nin GT motorsport.\nLotus Motorsport announced the Evora Cup/Cup\nGT4 race cars together with an innovative European\npoints-based race series for 2010 and the Cup GT4 made\nits first public appearance at the Autosport International\nracing car show in Birmingham, UK on the 14th of\nJanuary 2010.

Alongside the new\nmodel, Lotus also revealed the Evora IPS (Intelligent\nPrecision Shift) that introduced a Lotus-developed\nsix-speed automatic transmission.\nEvora S\nType 122\ndrive modes. The driver also had the option of selecting\n‘sport’ mode, which released a more sporting driving\nexperience allowing the driver to really feel each gear\nshift, yet be in complete control of the transmission.\nCommenting on the development, Dany Bahar\nsaid: “The Evora IPS is set to broaden the appeal of\nthe Evora and reach out to a slightly different market.\nWe hope it will be popular with established automatic\nlocations such as Asia, the Middle East and the US. It\nhas been a long time since Lotus created an automatic\nand we’ve spent a great deal of time refining this one\nto make sure that it perfectly complements the Evora\ndrive experience.”\n“The six-speed IPS system developed by Lotus is an\noption on both the standard Evora and the Evora S. In\none way, IPS adapts to your driving style, ensuring the\ncar is in exactly the right gear at the right moment to\nsuit every situation. You steer, accelerate and brake\nas normal; the IPS takes care of the rest.”\n“When you want more control, a pair of paddle\nshifts sit behind the steering wheel – flip right to change\nup, left to change down. And to avoid sudden engine\nbraking, IPS induces ultra-quick throttle blipping during\ndownshifts to harmonise engine and gearbox speeds.\nThe driving modes on the IPS are controlled from the\ncentre console. Performance is characterised by\nsmoothness, ride, handling and power delivery.”\nThe power unit on the Evora S saw a Harrop\nHTV1320 supercharger assembly (utilising Eaton\nTwin Vortex Series (TVS) Technology) attached to the\nmid-mounted, dohc, 24-valve, water-cooled aluminium\n2GR-FE engine that still featured Dual-Variable Valve\nTiming operated by the Lotus-developed T6e engine\ncontrol unit. On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) coupled\nto a three-way catalytic converter ensured that the\nEvora S was fully Euro V emissions compliant.\nDany Bahar, new Chief Executive Officer at Lotus,\nwho had joined the company in September of 2009,\nsummed it up beautifully when he said: “You don’t\nrealise what you were missing from your driving\nexperience until you get behind the wheel of the\nEvora S. It’s the next level of Evora experience. It\ncommunicates with you better; the suspension setting\nhas been fine tuned for added power and control so it\nresponds even more to direction. It’s an instinctual car,\nthe experience is pure. We were proud of the Evora but\nwe’re even prouder of the Evora S, I feel like it does the\ntrue Lotus experience justice. The really great thing is\nthat as we move forward the standard Evora should\nalso benefit from some of these developments.”\nThe Evora S came with a sport pack as standard, an\noption that featured a ‘sport’ button which allowed the\ndriver to control throttle response and activate the\nexhaust by-pass valve. The sport button also raised\nthe instantaneous rev limit and changed the dynamic\nstability control settings resulting in a total experience\nchange. The external emotion of the Evora S was also\nimproved with a completely new active exhaust setting,\nwhich, at the push of a button, could make the car\nsound just as dramatic as it looked.\nThe Evora S was certainly a natural progression for\nLotus, but more than that, it offered a taste of what\npeople could expect from the next generation of Lotus\ncars. It retained core Lotus values such as ‘Performance\nthrough Lightweight’ but it offered more than that; it\nwas the perfect combination of top performance, style\nand comfort.\nIn addition to the Evora S, Lotus also revealed the\nIPS (Intelligent Precision Shift) option. This inception of\nthe Evora saw an automatic 6-speed gearbox with Lotus\ndeveloped transmission control that allowed the driver\nto switch between manual paddle shift and automatic"

Sport Mode increased the traction\nslip threshold and removed understeer recognition,\nallowing the driver more vehicle control before an\nintervention was required. The Sport button also\nworked its magic on the IPS system when fitted. When\nengaged, the IPS took on a new lease of life, lifting the\nrevs to an assertive growl, shifting gears faster and at\nhigher revs. The Sport mode applied in automatic as\nwell as paddle-shift mode.\nOfficial Lotus Cars performance figures quoted for\nthe Evora S gave a 0-60mph time of 4.6 seconds and a\nmaximum (where permitted) of 172mph. Interestingly,\nalthough the top speed when fitted with IPS was down\nslightly to 167mph, Lotus numbers gave a faster\n0-60mph time of 4.5 seconds for the Evora S when\nfitted with the IPS option.\nOver the course of the following years there would\nbe several unique Limited Edition versions of the Evora\nS that included both short-run and one-off editions\nsuch as the Pearl White with yellow interior, ‘Freddie\nMercury Edition’, a ‘The Who Evora S’ and a ‘Naomi\nfor Japan’ one-off. The four ‘Heritage Racing Edition’\ncars built (from an intended run of 15) came in green\nand yellow as you would expect, the blue, silver and red\n‘Essex Racing Edition’ cars (with red interior) numbered\njust three. Then there was the now highly collectible\nand sought after ‘Evora S GP Edition’, of which 25\nwere built worldwide, all in Black and Gold with red\naccents (right).

The difference here was that you\nwere behind the wheel, and all alone.\nWell, not completely alone. For mere mortals, driving\nthe Lotus Type 125 took a bit of getting used to, and\nLotus was there to help owners get the most out of\nthemselves and the car. By placing an order for the Type\n125, not only did you get a 590kg (1300lb), 640bhp\nstate-of-the-art machine, you also got some very famous\nmentors, which at the time the Type 125 was launched,\nincluded several ex-Formula 1 drivers.\nThe car needed to be designed to give a breathless and\nauthentic Formula 1 experience while being forgiving,\nsafe, reliable and above all else, possible for people other\nthan ‘Super-heroes’ to drive.\nFormula 1 legend and Lotus ambassador Jean Alesi\nheaded up the car’s on-track development from the start.\n“Every Formula 1 driver arrives in the sport with a lot of\nexperience, they’re very fit and thin. Most normal people\ncouldn’t even fit in an F1 car let alone drive it.\nIt can be very difficult. The Type 125 gives you all the fun of an F1 car, but without the\npain. It is still very physical, but it is easier to control and with a bigger cockpit. It is also\neasier to maintain, and you don’t need a crew of a dozen people to start it up and keep\nit running, like you do in a Grand Prix. Instead, the Type 125 started at the touch\nof a button. All of this, I said from the very beginning, would be very important\nfor our customers.”\nThe project had been in development for over two years before, in September of\n2011, Group Lotus sent the car to Enstone, the headquarters of its namesake Formula 1\nteam, for its final phase of development. In November, future Lotus Formula 1 Racing\ndriver Romain Grosjean put the Type 125 through its paces at Portugal’s Portimao\ncircuit, working with engineers to hone the car’s characteristics and performance\nenvelope to replicate those of a current generation Formula 1 car, while keeping it safe,\napproachable and reliable for private customers.\n“The idea was to bring the car as close as possible to F1 level,” explained GP2\nchampion Romain who, by 2012 would be promoted to an F1 race seat with Lotus. “We\nneeded a car that was close to the lap time of a Formula 1 car, but that was also easy to\ndrive. We achieved a strong level of performance and sensation, but it is not too hard or\ntoo on-the-limit to drive, which is important. We did a lot of laps during our three-day\ntest and we had no reliability issues at all. Everything worked perfectly.”\nInside and out of the cockpit, the Type 125 was hard to differentiate from a current\nGP car. With a huge amount of down-force on the car – more than F1 rules actually\nallowed at the time – largely aided by a huge rear diffuser, the Enstone team also helped\nLotus work on build quality, something an F1 team knows more about than any other\nindustry. The Type 125’s, 640bhp, 3.8-litre Cosworth V8 engine – much like the one\nused in IndyCar racing was linked to a six-speed gearbox with paddle shift. The car’s\nfeather-weight 590kg resulted in a phenomenal power-to-weight of nearly 1000bhp per\ntonne. “That’s more than enough,” confirmed Alesi. “It is much faster than the Formula\n1 cars I drove in the 1990s.” For those with the means, the Type 125 was the chance to\nput themselves in the shoes of their heroes like Mansell and Alesi.\nMODEL\nType 125\nNAME/FORMULA\nTrackcar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2010-11\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nCosworth GPV8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3500cc/640bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n193.5in/74.5in/38in\nWHEELBASE\n126in\nWEIGHT\n1235lb/590kg"

Electrical power was stored in a lithium polymer\nbattery pack optimised for energy density, efficiency and\nhigh power demand, mounted in the centre of the\nvehicle for stability and safety. Additional range was\nprovided by the Lotus Range Extender engine, an\noptimised 1.2-litre, three-cylinder engine, designed\nspecifically for series hybrid vehicles. The drivetrain\nwas designed to combine astonishing performance\nwith efficient, low emissions driving.\nDriver involvement was enhanced by the\nincorporation of HALOsonic Internal and External\nElectronic Sound Synthesis technologies from Lotus and\nHarman International, which provided sound contouring\nwithin the cabin and improved pedestrian safety outside\nthe vehicle.

There was also a futuristic sound and\na combination of a conventional engine and a futuristic\nsound, enhancing the brand identity of the vehicle as\na step forward in electric vehicle design.\nIntegrated with the HALOsonic technology, the Evora\n414E Hybrid also showcased a brand new technology\nfrom Lotus Engineering, a sports mode that simulates\na 7-speed, paddle shift transmission and commands\nexceptional driver involvement (for a hybrid sports car)\nwhile optimising energy recuperation.\nDr. Robert Hentschel, the Director of Lotus\nEngineering, said, “Innovation has always been at the\nheart of Lotus and is needed now more than ever.\nThe Evora 414E Hybrid is the perfect demonstration\nThe Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid was so named because the\nenvironmentally focused technology demonstrator from\nLotus Engineering produced 414PS (306 kW) of power\nfrom a highly efficient propulsion system. The concept\nshowcased new developments in plug-in, range-extended\nelectric propulsion, new electronic technologies to\nenhance driver involvement, the adaptability of the Lotus\nVersatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA) that underpinned\nthe Evora 414E and a dramatic new roof system and\ninterior concept from Lotus Design.

The battery pack was optimised for\nenergy density, efficiency and high power demand, with over 100kW discharge capability.\nThe Lotus Range Extender engine provided 35kW(47bhp) of power at 3,500rpm via\nthe integrated electrical generator and featured an innovative architecture comprising an\naluminium monoblock construction, integrating the cylinder block, cylinder head and\nexhaust manifold in one casting. This resulted in reduced engine mass, assembly costs,\npackage size and improved emissions and engine durability.

The generator converted\nmechanical energy to electrical energy to replenish the battery pack charge and provide\nadditional vehicle range in a small lightweight package. The generator was also used as a\nmotor to start the range extender engine. The low mass of the range extender unit (85kg)\nand compact package made it ideal for the series hybrid drivetrain in the Evora 414E.\nFor everyday commuting journeys, up to 35 miles could be travelled using battery\npower. The battery could be charged overnight using a conventional domestic mains\nsupply through a socket concealed by the rear number plate. This permitted the vehicle\nto operate with zero tailpipe emissions. For longer journeys exceeding the battery\ncapacity, the highly efficient range extender engine was used as a generator to supply\nthe motor with electrical power and top up the battery.\nThe Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid offered exhilarating, all-round dynamic performance\nand took advantage of Lotus developed torque vectoring dynamics.

        "content": "2010\nThe Lotus Racing Formula 1 team was officially\nborn on September 12th, 2009. When the FIA\ngranted the team an entry into the 2010 FIA\nFormula 1 World Championship it meant the\nLotus name would be back on the Formula 1\ngrid for the first time since 1994, a season that\nhad seen the Lotus Type 109 running in Grand\nPrix racing. The second of three new Formula 1\nteams for the 2010 season, Lotus Racing\nunveiled the T127 (Type 127) Grand Prix\ncontender at London’s Royal Horticultural Halls\nin mid-February.\nThe brainchild of Tony Fernandes who, together with fellow shareholders\nKamarudin Meranun and SM Nasarudin lead a consortium of Malaysian business\ninterests to join forces to provide initial funding for the team under the parent\ncompany 1Malaysia Racing Team. Owned by Malaysian businessman Tony\nFernandes, the new team had ties with the Lotus Cars brand through one the team’s\nfinancial backers Proton, who at the time owned the Lotus brand.\nThe unveiling of the T127, interestingly named to fit within the Lotus Type\nnumber sequence despite the fact that the new team was not corporately linked to\nLotus Cars, was attended by some of the team’s top big wigs, including new technical\ndirector Mike Gascoyne who had previously held the position with both the Toyota\nand Force India teams. Joining Gascoyne in the launch of the new car were Jarno\nTrulli and Heikki Kovalainen who were given the distinction of piloting the first\nLotus cars to race in Formula 1 for 16 years.\nDevelopment of the 2010 car started late, due to the late acceptance of the\nteam’s entry. On 14 September 2009, the first four people started work, in what was\nessentially a bare, empty factory in Hingham, Norfolk, just 10-miles from the Lotus\nCars HQ at Hethel. When Kovalainen visited the Lotus Racing factory for the first\ntime, people were still building the walls and floors. By November, they had a mock\nengine design, were working with Fondtechon aerodynamics, and soon announced\nthey would be using engines supplied by Cosworth, along with a 7-speed, longitudinal,\nsemi-automatic gearbox from Xtrac.\nThe design was revealed to the press in October 2009 and, as the team started\na wind tunnel programme in November, Gascoyne and Fernandes gave a joint\ninterview saying they were “certainly feeling the pressure of the famous name.”\nFormula 1\nType 127\nThe late start by the team no doubt defined the\ndesign of the green and yellow Lotus T127 as super-\nconservative, with bulbous, flat-top, sidepods and an\noverall short, wide configuration. As the team had little\ndata to work from, they were cautious with the cooling\nand had to design aspects such as the brake ducts to the\nmaximum size. With no re-fuelling for 2010, brakes\nwere certainly going to be at a premium and brake-wear\na significant factor.\nAgain, with very little data to work from as to the\n90-degree V8 Cosworth’s fuel consumption at the new\nhigher 18,000rpm the engine was now being set to run\nat, the size of the fuel tank was a big unknown, and\ndictated a larger tank that certainly compromised the\noverall design package. The cell was wide which\ncompromised the radiators and substantially affected\nthe aerodynamics on the four chassis’ that would be\nbuilt during the year.\nFront and rear suspension followed accepted Formula 1\npractice and was by double-wishbone and pushrod\noperated inboard springs and rockers, moderated by\nPenske dampers. The forged magnesium BBS wheels\nwere 13-inch diameter at both the front and rear and\nwore the regulation Bridgestone Potenza rubber.\nRight from the first round of the season in Bahrain,\nthe double-diffuser didn’t live up to expectations on the\nlevel of downforce the team was hoping for. An update\nat the fifth race of the year, the Spanish GP\n, which\nconsisted of lighter suspension and bodywork (by\naround 20kg) allowed the required ‘ballast’ to be used\nto better match weight distribution and gave a useful\nperformance increase that saw Kovalainen finish\nan encouraging 14th.\nAt the European Grand Prix in Valencia in June,\nthe team marked the 500th race in the Lotus marque’s\nhistory with a lowly 21st place finish for Jarno Trulli\nthe best they could manage. Although the season didn’t\nprovide any top ten points finishes, a 12th place by\nKovalainen in Japan meant Lotus Racing finished the\nyear tenth in the championship and well ahead of the\nother two new teams (HRT and Virgin). Tenth place\nin the championship ensured that Lotus would take\na sizeable share of the contructors’ kitty for 2011 and\nleast gave positive future financial implications."

Managed by a new\nLotus T6e controller, and mated to a new 6-speed type\nEC60 transmission (with constant mesh helical gears and\nopen differential), and revised rear subframe the set-up\ngave a 0-60mph time of 6 seconds (up 0.4 seconds),\n0-100mph in 18.6 seconds and a maximum speed\nof 127mph.\nThe lightweight in-line four gave very similar\nperformance to the old, lower-power 1.8 that used to\nreside in the S, but as well as 9lbft more torque, the more\nefficient new engine and gearbox combination brought a\nmajor bonus – fuel economy improved from 37.2mpg to\n45mpg and an impressively low CO2 emissions of just\n149g/km (down from 179) meant supercar performance\ncombined with city car economy.\nThe fully independent suspension utilizing unequal\nlength wishbones, Bilstein monotube gas dampers, Eibach\ncoaxial coil-springs at each corner and front anti-roll\nbar remained unchanged from the earlier car. “We\nexperimented with different settings,” said executive\nengineer Matt Becker, “but we just kept coming back\nto the same thing. It works, why change it?”\nThe Servo-assisted, track tuned 4-channel Antilock\nBraking System, with Lotus/AP-Racing twin-piston\naluminium alloy front brake calipers, and Brembo single\npiston sliding rear calipers, acting on cast-iron ventilated\ndiscs (282mm diameter, 26mm thick) all round, also\nremained un-changed.\nTo the Lotus purist, the Elise package, with its crisp\nstyle and excellent chassis remained intact, but the engine\nwas now sweeter and greener, and the gearchange better.\nIt continued to deliver exactly what you expected –\npared-back thrills where, above everything else, the\ndriving experience takes priority."

        "content": "\nAnyone under the misapprehension that Lotus might be\nmoving away from ‘performance through lightweight’\nphilosophy, only needed to take a ride in the new Elise\nClub Racer announced in February of 2011, to know\nthat this was definitely not the case.\nThe engineers at Lotus put the lightest car of their\ncurrent range on a diet, and managed to shed a further\n24kg. So how did they manage to make one of the lightest\nmodels on the market even lighter? The engineers behind\nthe Elise Club Racer took a stripped-to-the-bare-bone\napproach, emphasised by the body-coloured seats, but\nmaterialised in many other ways, such as the motorsport\nderived lightweight battery and the deletion of certain\nstandard factory fitted components such as carpets, radio\nand speakers, passenger footrest, central locking, mudflaps\nand noise insulation.\nAttention to even the smallest of details ensured that\nLotus’ passion for performance through lightweight was\ntranslated throughout the car. For the first time ever, an\nElise variant came complete with a Sport setting for the\nDPM (Dynamic Performance Management), allowing\neven the less experienced sports car drivers to feel at the\ntop of their game, while the ability to switch it off\ncompletely pleased the more established track-orientated\ndrivers. DPM combined with improved agility courtesy\nof Lotus’ finely tuned sport suspension and an Eibach\nanti-roll bar, made the Elise Club Racer equally versatile\nfor both road and race track fun.\nWolf Zimmermann the Chief Technical Officer Lotus\nCars said, “The traditional Lotus approach of reduction\nand purity has lead to one of the most zeitgeist and\ncontemporary sports cars around. For over 15 years, the\nLotus Elise has become an icon in the sports car market,\ncarving out a niche market with a dedicated following of\nlightweight fans. The new Club Racer will definitely give\nthese people something extra to get their teeth stuck\ninto. This car epitomises everything that’s cool about\nthe Elise – it’s fast, raw, responsive and a huge amount\nof fun to drive.”\nElise Club Racer\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise Club Racer\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2011\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n437\nENGINE TYPE\nToyota 1ZR-FAE, 4-cyl, VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1595cc/140bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n149in/73in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n1878lb/852kg\nPowered by the same all alloy, 1.6-litre DOHC, 1ZR- FAE, 4-cylinder, dual VVT-i\nand Valvematic engine as the standard Elise, but with a 6bhp increase (partially due\nto the Sports Exhaust system), at £27,500 the Elise CR certainly offered purity,\nperformance and pleasure at an affordable price. With 140bhp it could reach 60mph in\n6 seconds, and achieve a maximum speed of 127mph. It was designed to please the eye\nas well as the soul, with a choice of six striking colours (Sky Blue, Saffron Yellow, Ardent\nRed, Aspen White, Matt Black and Carbon Grey) and bespoke design elements such as\nthe matt-black 12-spoke wheels and black body accents (side mirrors, rear panel and roll-\nbar) that emphasised the sporting character of the car.

As such, it was used as a base point from\nwhich both the GT2 and GTE homologated cars for the\nFIA (Federation Internationale de l’Automobile) and\nACO (l’Automobile Club de l’Ouest) endurance racing\nseries were built and developed.\nThe Evora Enduro GT was powered by a 4.0-litre\nCosworth-tuned, dry-sump race version of the VVT-i\n2GR-FE V6 engine, making 440bhp and 332lbft of\ntorque at 5,500rpm. Engine cooling was provided by\na twin-core high ambient radiator aluminium end tank\nradiator/Laminova heat exchanger. Thanks to the\naddition of lightweight components and panels, such\nas carbon-fibre doors and polycarbonate windows all\naround, the car weighed in at just under 2,600lb and\nproved a competitive package right ‘out of the box’.\nThe dramatic looking race car came complete with\nan aerodynamic package that included a full aero front\nsplitter, a huge rear wing, and full underbody rear diffuser,\nalthough the carbon-fibre roof was listed as an option!\nAlso fitted were an FIA-approved fuel system and roll\ncage, a HANS-compliant carbon-fibre driver’s seat with\na matching harness system, HANS-compliant passenger\nseat with six-point harness and Cosworth Omega\ninstruments with gear indicator.\nOther race-ready features included a sintered dual-plate\nclutch, Öhlins shock absorbers, and uni-ball wishbone\njoints for optimum adjustability. There were also Alcon\nsix-piston race brake calipers on the front, and four piston\ncalipers on the rear, these clamped the two-piece discs\nwith 22mm race pads. Forged aluminium 18x8.5-inch\nwheels in front and 18x10-inch wheels completed the\npackage and offered centre-hub spindles enabling quick\nchanges at the track, and to top off the race-car character\nof the Evora Enduro GT\n, it also came with a four-point\nair-jack system which lifted the car off the ground at the\ntouch of a button and an ATL ‘dry break’ quick-fill 120-\nlitre fuel tank linked to the FIA FT3 approved fuel system\nwith internal high pressure pump, regulator and filter.\nThe rear wheels got their power from the engine\nthrough an Xtrac 426 six-speed sequential transmission\n(mounted to a bespoke alloy cast bell housing), with\ntransverse layout dog engagement, reverse and neutral\nengagement, and an external oil cooler reverse cut\ndirectly onto the primary shaft. An optional pneumatic\npaddle-shift system could also be fitted. The superb race\nhandling came by means of the forged double wishbone layout, four-way adjustable\nÖhlins TTX36 dampers, coaxial coil springs, increased camber, and adjustable anti-roll\nbars, all attached to the customary Lotus modular lightweight bonded aluminium\nchassis structure.\nMarch 2011 also saw the debut of the Evora GTS, the race-going sibling of the\nEvora road car. In the hands of Stefano d’Aste, Gianni Giudici and Marco Fumagalli\nthe green and yellow Lotus Sport Italy car took a solid victory in the GT Production class\nat the Monza 4-hour race. Eligible to race in that year’s Lotus Cup Series as well as the\nEuropean Endurance Championship, the Evora GTS was equipped with the 3.5-litre,\nV6 Charge-Cooled and Supercharged Engine, producing 345bhp at 6500rpm. Without\nthe lightweight panels and windows of the Enduro, the GTS weighed around 200lb\nmore than its black & gold liveried full-race brother, but was still an impressive 450lb\nunder the weight of the road-going 2011 Evora S.\n249"

A category which included the world\nfamous Le Mans 24-Hours, an event that had\nnot seen an official Lotus supported entry since\na pair of green and yellow Hugh Chamberlain\nType 82 Esprit Sport 300s had competed in\nthe 1994 running of the race.\nIn the autumn of 2010 Lotus Motorsport announced\nhugely ambitious plans for the future, and, by January of\n2011, Austrian team JetAlliance Racing was announced\nas official partner for the Evora GTE’s maiden season.\nTwo cars were to be entered in the Intercontinental\nLe Mans Cup (ILMC), which included all the major\nendurance races such as the Sebring 12-Hours and\nthe 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nGiven the short timeframe, the latest motorsport\neffort to come out of the Group Lotus organisation\nproved to be one of the firm’s most ambitious yet.\n“When we mentioned to the design team and some of\nour contractors that we were going to go to Le Mans,\nthey didn’t think it would have 2011 in the date, they\nwere looking at 2012! But everything that Lotus is doing\nat the moment is aggressive timing and we’re delivering\neverything that we say we’re going to do,” Lotus\nMotorsport Product Manager Gavan Kershaw stated.\nAt first glance, the new GTE-spec Evora racecar may\nhave seemed to have a similar appearance to the Evora\nGT4, which debuted in 2010, but as Kershaw explained,\n“roughly 85 percent of the car is brand-new, with the\n2011\nMODEL\nType 124\nNAME/FORMULA\nEvora GTE (GT2) Racecar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2011\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2\nENGINE TYPE\nToyota-Cosworth V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3995cc/470bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n172in/77/43in\nWHEELBASE\n101.5in\nWEIGHT\n2745lb/1245kg\nEvora GTE Racecar\nType 124\nproduction chassis remaining one of the only key\ncomponents that’s been carried over.” With their\nCosworth-tuned engines bored out from 3.5 to 4.0-litres\nand all-new bodywork as well as larger wheels and\nuprights, the Nicola Scimeca-designed Evora GTE was\nalmost 120lb heavier than the GT4 model, yet was still\nconsidered a lightweight in the GTE racing category.\nDespite the engineering challenges, the program\nremained relatively on schedule, with the first Evora GTE\nhitting the track in early April and completing around\n1,000 miles of testing. A further 700 miles were logged at\nthe cars first public appearance, the one-day Le Mans test.\nUnder the careful direction of Team Manager Jan\nKalmar, the JetAlliance team fielded two cars in the 2011\nLe Mans 24-hour race and, having qualified well in the\nnew GTE class, both cars ran strongly. The number 64\ncar of Martin Rich, John Hartshorne and Oskar Slinger\nretired on lap 127 when a broken wheel left the car\nstranded on track. Remarkably though, the 65 car of\nJohnny Mowlem, James Rossiter and Jonathan Hirschi\nlasted the full 24-hours and was classified 22nd overall.\nAn excellent result given short the development time.\n250"

Initially we hoped to introduce this to the Asian\nmarket with our partners in China as a ‘taste of Lotus’.\nHowever, the response was so great that we received 114\norders from China alone. This justified us looking in to\nspeeding up the process of bringing this car to other\nterritories. We showed a concept at Pebble Beach and are\nshowing this production intent car at Frankfurt. We will\nbring this car to Europe and the US. People get so excited\nwhen they see and especially hear it for the first time.\nIt’s a very special car and will appeal to a very special\ntype of driver – and they won’t be disappointed!”\nProducing over 444bhp from the race-developed\nEvora GTE’s supercharged V6 engine, this was, quite\nsimply, set to be the most powerful Lotus road car that\nhad ever been built. Transferring this power to the road,\nthrough a sequential AMT racing gearbox were\nlightweight, forged alloy rims, with centre lock hubs shod\nwith Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tyres. Yet, contrary to its\nextreme roots, the Evora GTE road car was also set to\ndeliver a comfortable and refined element to its high\nperformance driving characteristics.\nEvora GTE Concept Car\nType 122\nTo fit with the Lotus Lightweight DNA, clever use of\ncarbon-fibre was integrated extensively throughout the\nexterior and interior of the car, and this was one of the\nmajor contributors to the 230lb weight reduction versus\nthe base Evora. Carbon-fibre was used for all the\nbodywork modifications including the front and rear\nbumpers, the rear wing and the doors. Under the skin,\nthe GTE concept was a pure race car but the driver was\ncocooned in a stunning, modern race themed interior,\nwhere leather and carbon fibre dominated.\nLightweight Recaro carbon-fibre seats clasped both\nthe passenger and driver; the driver taking command\nof the car through a lightweight forged magnesium\nrimmed race specification steering wheel.\nAfter a brief appearance in concept form at Pebble\nBeach (right) where it was shown with a revised rear wing\nsetup compared to the initial prototype (below), just a few\nweeks later, in September of 2011, the production version\nof the Evora GTE concept ‘Special Edition’ was revealed\nto the public at the Frankfurt Motor Show.\nAccording to Lotus Motorsport, there were\napproximately 30 Evora GTE road cars built, however\nthe GTE project was cancelled before it was completed\nand the cars went into storage. That was, until September\n2014, when Lotus Motorsport refinished (reworked) 20 of\nthe cars and released them for sale as the Evora 350GT\n.\nThe remaining cars were disassembled for spare parts.\nAlthough officially sold as the Evora 350GT these 20 cars\nwere usualy refered to by dealers as the Evora GTE.\n251"

Although it weighed over 400lb more than before (up 22\npercent), it also boasted 35 percent more power. Which,\nput simply, meant the power-to-weight ratio increased\nfrom 288bhp/tonne to 319bhp/tonne.\nFrom headlights to rear wing, the aggressive stance of\nthe Exige S underlined its performance pedigree. Track\ninspired details such as the all-new aerodynamic package\nthrough to its race-inspired steering wheel and supportive\nseats amplified the potent abilities of a car that was listed\nat £54,900 on the late 2011 Lotus price sheet.\nCommenting on the Exige S, Group Lotus Chief\nExecutive Officer Dany Bahar said: “\nAnyone who has ever\ndriven an Exige will tell you that it’s not for the fainthearted.\nThe new Exige S skips a few rungs on the ladder to give the\ndriver the ultimate Lotus experience.

By 2012 however, the F1 team based\nout of Norfolk would be re-branded as Caterham F1.\nOn 5 October 2010 the team announced that they\nhad agreed a deal with Red Bull Technology for the\nsupply of their seven-speed, semi-automatic gearbox and\nhydraulic systems for 2011. On November 5th, the team\nconfirmed an engine partnership for the next two years\nwith Renault, and on November 30th, the FIA released\nthe entry list for the 2011 season in which the former\nLotus Racing were listed under the name “Team Lotus.”\nOne of the most striking details of the Lotus TL11\n(T128) was its lack of a roll hoop, in its place a ‘blade’.\nThe concept was essentially the same as that employed\non the Mercedes MGP W01, removing the hoop and\nrelocating the intakes for the 90-degree Renault V8\nengine to lower on the engine cover, whilst fulfilling the\nrequirement for a roll over structure with a solid central\nstructure (or blade). It was said that this approach gave the\nall-important and much cleaner airflow to the rear wing.\nAfter the MGP W01 version was fully revealed at the\nSpanish Grand Prix queries were raised about the safety\nof the concept, would the blade dig into the ground in a\nroll over? The rule makers took heed and the following\nappeared in the 2011 technical regulations: 15.2.4\nThe principal roll structure must have a minimum enclosed structural\ncross section of 10,000mm2, in vertical projection, across a\nhorizontal plane 50mm below its highest point. The area thus\nestablished must not exceed 200mm in length or width and may\nnot be less than 10,000mm2 below this point.\nMany took this as an outright ban on the blade\nconcept but Mike Gascoyne and his team thought\ndifferently, and the TL11 met the new regulation fully.\nPerhaps it could be said that this was the latest in a long\nline of innovations from Team Lotus. Having said that,\nroll blades were nothing new in Formula 1. They had first\nappeared on a number of cars in the 1985 including the\nArrows A8, Ligier JS25, and Brabham BT54. But the\nconcept was short lived, fading out by mid 1986. Until\n2011 that was.\nThe car itself was less block-like around the midriff\nthan the 2010 car had been, but still a little less svelte than\nmany of the other team cars on the grid in 2011. The\nnose was more sculpted and higher than previously seen\non the T127.\nDictated by the adoption of the Red Bull gearbox,\nthe rear suspension on the T128 was revised from the\nprevious year to adopt a pull-rod rather than push-rod\nsystem. The front did however remain similar to the\nprevious year with the carbon wishbones, torsion-bar\nsprings and an anti-roll bar activated by push-rods.\nWheels were BBS 13-inch diameter fitted this time\nfitted with Pirelli PZero rubber. Brake calipers were of\nthe AP variety and fitted with either Carbone Industrie\nor Hitco pads and discs.\nTeam Lotus skipped the first day of the Valencia test\nopting to carry out a private test day at the end of the\nweek instead. It was a good call as a power steering issue\ndogged the car after its roll out on Wednesday. This\nlimited most of the test to looking at launch systems,\naero testing and basic systems checks and also meant\nthat the team was lacking on long runs and tyre data\n(it was running too slowly to really work the rubber).\nMODEL\nType 128\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2011\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nRenault RS27-2011\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2400cc/765bhp\nLENGTH-WIDTH-HEIGHT mm/in\n5000/196.8 - 1800/70.8 - 950/37.4\nWHEELBASE\n3100mm/122.05in\nWEIGHT (regulation)\n1411lb/640kg\nThe 2011 season saw Team Lotus pull away in performance from fellow new teams\nHRT and Virgin, but fail to close in on the lower-ranking established teams.

At the rear though, the Elise S could be\neasily identified over the standard car, where a new body\nhugging rear wing arched all the way over the car’s hind\nquarters. This had the advantage of also creating an\nincrease in downforce compared to that of the standard\nrear clamshell, and helped provide more stability at\nnear-maximum speeds.\nWith the Elise S being dropped and replaced\nby what was simply called the ‘Elise’ (see p244),\nsomewhat confusingly, but more consistent with\nthe naming of the Evora range, the 2012 model\nyear supercharged Elise would be called the\nElise S. With a new 1.8l 2ZR-FE engine giving\n217bhp and a power delivery that resulted in\neven more torque, the new model was blessed\nwith truly astonishing performance.\nThere was also new look exhaust exit with a silver\nanodized finish, as well as a new design of Y-spoke\nlightweight cast 6-spoke wheel, 16-inch at the front and\n17-inch at the rear. Tyres were still the Elise specific\nYokohama Advan AD07 LTS (175/55ZR16 front and\n225/45ZR17 rear). Under the rear hatch was a new\nstylish design of engine cover, and at the back a new Elise\n‘S’ badge (carried over from the Evora S) was evident.\nThe standard Elise S interior came with the regular\naluminium passenger footrest, a black plain/perforated\nleather steering wheel, a black leather gear lever gaiter,\nand a polished aluminium gear knob and handbrake\nsleeve. In addition, there were also three option packages\navailable. The Touring Pack featured leather ProBax\nseats, padded leather door panels, perforated leather door\ninserts, a leather-trimmed centre console, black perforated\nleather handbrake lever gaiter, black carpet mats with\nembroidered Elise logo, noise insulation panelling,\nauxiliary driving lights, an i-Pod connection, a cup\nholder, and Cruise control.\nThe Sport Pack that was also available added Bilstein\nSports Dampers, silver 14-spoke forged wheels and\nProBax sports seats to the base model ‘S’, and the ‘Black\nStyle Pack’ as its name suggested, gave buyers a satin\nblack version of the new Y-spoke wheels and a black\nrear diffuser.\nAll in all, the 2011 Elise S offered a real argument\nfor the being the best ever road-going (rather than track\noriented) Elise. The engine delivered an almost perfect\namount of power to be both fun and exploitable, and yet\nliveable on a day-to-day basis. And to cap it all, the Elise S\nmade tangible improvements in terms of both emissions\nand economy.\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise S\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2012-15\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n454\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota 2ZR-FE, 4-cylinder, VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/217bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150.5in/67.5/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n2037lb/924kg\n2012\nElise S\nType 111\n254"

As on the Exige S, the engine was mated\nwith a six-speed manual transaxle as standard equipment.\nIn common with the Exige S, the Roadster also came with\ntwo different suspension settings: a standard suspension\nfor an active driving experience, suited for public roads,\nand an optional setting as part of the Race Pack,\ndeveloped for maximum performance during track use.\nDespite the fact that the Roadster lost over 150lb\ncompared to the coupé, (which was now weighing in at\n2570lb and being one of the lightest six-cylinder roadsters\non the market by some margin) the 0-60 time remained\nthe same at 3.8 seconds, as did the 0-100mph figure of\n8.5 seconds. The top speed however, was now limited to\nExige S Roadster\nType 111\n145mph compared to the 170mph of the coupé. Fuel economy figures for the Roadster\n(with manual gearbox) were quoted in Lotus brochures as 19.5mpg (urban), 37.2mpg\n(extra urban) and 28.0mpg (combined). A figure of just 236g/km was given for the\nCO2 emissions.\nInside, the car was a lesson in functionality, although Lotus did offer customers the\nchance to opt for a comfort enhanced plush interior or, go for a more stripped down,\nsporty option. The bad news for customers in the USA was that, as with the Exige S, the\n£52,900 Roadster (at its official release in 2013), was to only be offered in the European\nand Asian markets, and wouldn’t be making it across the Atlantic for the US market.\nUnveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show and blessed\nwith both a sub-four second dash to reach the 60mph\nmark and a top speed of 145mph (electronically limited)\nthe 3.5-litre, supercharged V6-powered Exige S Roaster\nbecame the quickest wind-in-the-hair soft top to have\nemerged from the Hethel works since they were opened\nback in 1967.\nWhen, a few weeks before the 2012 Geneva Motor\nShow, Lotus announced they would “blow the top off ”\nat the Geneva show, most people thought that they\nwould see a convertible version of the Evora, but they\nwere wrong. Lotus had decided to bring out the\nExige S Roadster.\nAs Lotus order books for the Roadster opened in May\nof 2013 and the first car came off the production line, the\nLotus PR department described the car thus: “The Exige\nS Roadster is the perfect car for a ‘joy’ ride; what better\nway is there to enjoy the panoramic views of the world’s\nmost beautiful roads than when they are enhanced by the\npurposeful roar of a V6 soundtrack and to feel the wind\nin your hair and sun on your skin?”\nCombining the pure performance of its coupé twin\nbrother, with the unique open air driving experience\nbeloved by so many Elise owners, its new, sleeker body\nwas designed, along with its sculptured, leaner shape\nallowed it to safely shed its aerodynamic aids in order to\nmaximise airflow with the roof off. It was the first Exige\noffered with a factory-fitted soft top, one which was both\ninstalled and removed manually of course.\nThe exterior of the Exige S Roadster was nearly\nidentical to that of the coupé model, the major difference\n(apart from the lack of roof) being that there was no low-\nlevel front splitter or rear spoiler as found on the closed\nmodel. The removal of the front splitter was a measure\nneeded to balance out the aero forces front to back, since\na rear spoiler on the coupé wasn’t needed with the missing\nroof. Eliminating the rear spoiler also made room for\neasy storage of the factory fitted soft-top.

In December the team announced\nthat GP2 Series champion and 2009 Renault F1 driver\nRomain Grosjean would race alongside Räikkönen in the\nnew, Renault-powered Lotus E20 chassis.

The team was also involved in\nan early season protest over the use of a “radical”\nrear wing concept on Mercedes AMG’s Mercedes\nF1 W03, later dubbed the ‘F-Duct rear wing’ or\n‘Double DRS’. The dispute was not settled\nuntil the third race in China when the stewards\nunanimously rejected their formal protest and\nLotus subsequently confirmed they would not\nappeal against the decision.\nPower for the E20 came from a 2.4-litre,\n90-degree V8 Renault RS27-2012 unit coupled to\nthe 7-speed, Lotus F1 Team/X-Trac gearbox and\nAP Racing clutch. The engine’s electronics system\ncame from Magneti Marelli managed by the now\nstandardised across all the teams, McLaren\nElectronics Systems ECU. Spark plugs were of\nthe NGK variety and fuel and oil were supplied\nby sponsor (or should we say ‘Partner’) Total.\nThe front suspension featured carbon-fibre\ndouble wishbones with pull-rod operated inboard\ntorsion-bar dampers. The rear end featured a\nsimilar wishbone set-up, but here a push-rod\nsystem operated torsion bars and transverse\ndamper units. There were rumours around\nthe Formula 1 scene that the car featured some\nsort of interlinked suspension technology but\nthat was always a difficult thing to asses and\nultimately was never a factor as the FIA banned\nany sort of hydraulically assisted suspension\nbefore the start of the year. Wheels were from\nOZ and of course shod with the regular Formula 1\ncontracted supplier Pirelli ‘P-Zero’ tyres. AP\nRacing again supplied the brake hardware\nwhile pads and discs came from Hitco.\nOn track, the E20’s strengths were clearly great driveability and the fact\nthat it was easy on it’s tyres, something probably connected to the fact it\nappeared to be a much softer riding car than most of its rivals.\nThe E20 was immediately quick and Lotus started the season strongly\nwith Grosjean qualifying third in Australia but first lap incidents in Australia\nand Malaysia ruined his chances of scoring his first Formula One points. In\nChina Räikkönen was running in second until his tyres dropped off, pushing\nhim out of the points for the only time of the season. In Bahrain, Lotus\nachieved their first podiums of the season with Räikkönen very close to\nthe winner Vettel and Grosjean behind in third. In Monaco Grosjean was\ninvolved in a first lap incident but in Canada he ran a one-stop race strategy\nto take second, his best Formula 1 finish. A race later in Valencia Grosjean\n(below) was running in a strong second until a mechanical problem put him\nout leaving Räikkönen to take another podium in second.\nIn Germany, Hungary and Belgium Räikkönen took three more podiums.\nAt the Belgian Grand Prix, Grosjean was involved in a multiple car pileup\nat the start of the race, resulting in several cars being eliminated. After the\nrace, Grosjean was issued with a one-race ban covering the next Round at\nMonza where he was replaced for the race weekend by Lotus reserve\ndriver Jérôme d’Ambrosio.\nAfter a near win in Bahrain, Räikkönen took the team’s first victory at\nthe Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It was also his first race win after returning to\nFormula 1. After finishing in the points in 19 of the 20 races, and achieving\nseven podiums (including the win in Abu Dhabi) Räikkönen finished third\nin the Drivers’ Championship with Lotus fourth in the Constructors’\nChampionship."

The American racing series was organized by\nthe people behind NASCAR and Lotus came to the series at the end of 2012 with\na new version of the Evora racecar, the GX.\nThe Evora GX was based loosely on the Evora GTC racer that had evolved\nfrom the 2011 Enduro model that had been crowned 2012 MSA British Endurance\nChampion in the regular GT class with the Bullrun Team. The race-spec Evora GX\nwas customized specifically for the rigors of Grand-Am racing. Among the notable\nnew features were; carbon-fibre doors, a roof and engine cover, plexiglass windows,\nand tinted headlights, which all helped to get weight down to around 2,535 pounds.\nThis was only an impressive 22 pounds heavier than the lithe Evora GTC, despite\nhaving a much thicker US-spec roll cage. The car also came with a new race-spec\naero kit with new parts being fitted in including a new front splitter and bumper, a\nseries-required rear wing, and new wider wheels wrapped in Continental racing tyres.\nTo meet other series requirements, ABS and traction control were removed,\nputting more emphasis on driver skill. There was also a new fuel filler system,\nContinental tyres, and yellow headlamps in order to tick all the specific US race\nseries boxes.\nMeanwhile, the interior was stripped of pretty much everything in favor of all\nthe race-spec requirements, particularly the bucket seats, the roll bars, and the race\nsteering wheel. However, a noticeable absence on the Evora GX was that of traction\ncontrol and ABS, which made racing the GX all the more challenging for the driver.\nEvora GX & GTC Racecar\nType 124\nMODEL\nType 124\nNAME/FORMULA\nEvora GX\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2012\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nnot available\nENGINE TYPE\nToyota-Cosworth V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3995cc/440bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n172in/77/43in\nWHEELBASE\n101.5in\nWEIGHT\n2535lb/1150kg\nHot off the back of unleashing its Evora GTC\nracer, Lotus Racing engineers got serious about\nhoning the Evora to meet the requirements of\nNorth America’s legendary sports car series,\nthe GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.\nAt the very least though, the drivers could rely on the\ncar’s 440-horsepower, 324lb ft of torque, 4.0-litre V6\nengine and its Xtrac six-speed, sequential transmission\nto make the drive of a $335,000 Grand-Am spec car\nthat much more interesting to drive. The Evora GX\nmade its racing debut late in the 2012 season under the\nMcMahon Raceworks/Condor Motorsport banner.\nAlongside the Evora GTC, Lotus Motorsport also\nproduced the Evora GTN trackday car package that\ncould be used to convert a road going Evora into a track\ncar that was suitable for use in the new Lotus Cup race\nseries ‘V6 Cup’ class reserved for GT4, GTS and GTN\nEvora racecars."

In fact, I even took part in the Talbot\nSunbeam Lotus’ Italian Rally championship,\nwinning a race in San Marino back in 1981, so this\nis very nostalgic for me. As we unveiled the Exige\nR-GT in Frankfurt, alongside one of the original\nSunbeam championship winning cars, it brought\nback many memories for me.”\n“With the new R-GT rules in rallying, it’s a\nvery interesting time for us to return to the sport.\nNaturally our approach this time around will be\ndifferent to when we won the championship three\ndecades ago, but I think our philosophy is\ndefinitely the same, we want to compete and\nultimately we want to win.”\nExige R-GT made its world debut on June 27th\nas a course car on the Geko Ypres rally in West\nFlanders, where Portuguese driver Bernardo\nSousa, who was set to race the Lotus Exige R-GT\nin anger later in the year, drove the car ahead\nof its entry in the FIA European Rally\nChampionship. Here the team took advantage of\nthe 18 special stages of the rally to test different\nset-ups, engine modes and electronics solutions.\nThere were no major technical problems, only\nsome small teething issues regarded as normal\nin the development of the car that had covered\nonly 1,000km of testing to that point.\nOn July 26th, the Exige R-GT was the first car\nto pass the new FIA R-GT regulations and finally\nreceived its long-awaited homologation papers,\nand just two days later made its debut on round\nseven of the European Rally Championship in\nPortugal, the Rali Vinho da Madeira. Driven by\nBernardo Sousa and co-driver Corrado Mancini,\nthe first priority for the works Lotus International\nRally Team car was reliability over performance,\nas well as further fine-tuning the car during the\npunishing schedule of a rally weekend.\nClaudio Berro was looking forward to the\nevent. “This is a very exciting week for us. It’s\nbeen a long time coming because the R-GT\ncategory is all new, and it’s taken time for the\nrules to be written and, in turn, the car to comply\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige R-GT\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2012\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n1 (+?)\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i, 2GR-FE\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/309bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n159in/71in/45.5in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2645lb/1200kg (FIA minimum)\nExige R-GT\nType 111\nwith the championship. Nonetheless, the process on our side has been\nsmooth and the development of the car is really promising. We go to\nPortugal with realistic aims, primarily to work on reliability and\nperformance, but it’s going to be great to experience competition.\nThe R-GT class is sure to make rallying more appealing and thrilling than\never, and the acclaimed Exige will earn a huge following I’m sure.”\nIn the first special stage, the car ran well and recorded the seventh best\ntime. In the second special stage, however, the car suffered electronic\nproblems which affected all the major systems and of course its stage time,\nfinishing tenth. In the third and final stage another electronics glitch caused\nthe gearbox to fail, the wheels to lock, and Sousa and co-driver Corrado\nMancini to crash into a wall at slow speed.\n“I’m disappointed because I really wanted to finish the rally,” said\nBernardo Sousa, “but we can take heart that the potential is there. We\ncrashed out due to nothing more than a minor electrical failure, which is\nfrustrating, but not uncommon when you debut an all-new car. On Stage 3,\nwhen I braked, the gearbox wouldn’t downshift, the wheels locked, and we\ndidn’t make it through the corner. We crashed at about 40kph (25mph). The\nfirst stage was promising, though, particularly as there were lots of chicanes\nand we don’t have power steering. I know that on proper stages we can be a\nlot faster. I’m very confident the Exige R-GT can compete at a high level.”\nMadeira was the first taste of competition for the Exige R-GT rallycar,\nand although things rarely go smoothly on a debut, the pace was clearly\nthere. Although Lotus Cars withdrew their official support for the project\nat the end of 2013, with the R-GT class continuing in 2014 it was hoped that\nthe sole Exige R-GT built would be seen again on WRC events again, and\nbe able to fulfill its initial promise."

The livery was a slightly\ndifferent from the previous year’s in that the new\ncar had a black, gold and red livery with more\nvisible red on the sidepods, air intake, rear wing\nand front wing compared to the 2012 car where\nred only feature as Total oil and fuel branding.\nVery much a logical development of the previous years\ncar, the design team on the E21, again led by Martin\nTolliday, produced another car that was easy on its tyres\nand rode somewhat softly. The overall package was\nnaturally very similar to the E20 with power for the E21\ncoming from the 2013 version of the 2.4-litre, 90-degree\nV8 Renault RS27 unit. The 7-speed gearbox was now\ndesignated as a bespoke Lotus built unit rather than in\nconjunction with X-Trac as on the 2012 car. AP Racing\nagain provided the clutch and brake calipers although\nfor this year Carbone rather than Hitco supplied the\npads and discs.\nThe major change in philosophy of the E21 in\ncomparison to the E20 was in the sidepod/exhaust\nconfiguration. From the first concept the E21 featured\na Red Bull style, steeply ramped sidepod and lower inlet\ntunnel area. The 2013 system fed airflow from the bottom\nof the sidepod keeping it separate from the exhaust flow\nused to blow the brake ducts and diffuser sides. From the\nMalaysia race onwards, this feature of the car’s design\nFormula 1\nE21\nreceived updates with an exhaust arrangement that\nbrought it further forwards in the car allowing a steeper\nramp that did less to compromise the ‘coke-bottle’ profile\nof the lower rear bodywork. The team also continued to\nlead the way on the development of the front wing\nendplate area that helped guide air around the front tyres.\nChassis and suspension was fundamentally the same\nas on the 2012 car with the front suspension featuring\ncarbon-fibre double wishbones with pull-rod operated\ninboard torsion-bar dampers. A similar wishbone set-up\nfeatured at the rear but this time with a push-rod system\noperating on torsion bars and transverse damper units.\nThrough the early part of the year the design team\ncontinued to work on validating a longer-wheelbase\nversion of the car that was achieved by angling the front\nwishbones forward. The ‘longer’ car first ran in practice\nat Monza, made its race debut at Suzuka in October\nand ran for the remainder of the season.\nThe season had opened with the Australian Grand\nPrix in Melbourne where, despite only qualifying in\nseventh place, Räikkönen took a seemingly effortless\nvictory aided by a superb pit-stop strategy from the team\non the pit-wall. With Romain Grosjean, who started the\nrace in eighth place, finishing the race in tenth and taking\none point, Lotus F1 headed to the next race in Malaysia\nholding the lead in the Drivers’ Championship and\nsecond place in the Constructors’ Championship. The\nfirst time for as many years as anyone in the F1 paddock\ncould remember!\nAfter Räikkönen was penalised for impeding Nico\nHülkenberg in qualifying and Grosjean failed to make\nQ3, the Malaysian Grand Prix saw Lotus sit only tenth\nand eleventh on the starting grid. The race was better\nhowever and they finished seventh and sixth respectively.\nLower than they hoped, but enough to help them hold\non to second in the Constructors’ championship.\nMODEL\nLotus E21\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2013\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n5\nENGINE TYPE\nRenault RS27-2013 V8\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n2400cc/750bhp\nLENGTH-WIDTH-HEIGHT mm/in\n5088/200.3 - 1800/70.8 - 950/37.4\nWHEELBASE\n3100mm/122.05in\nWEIGHT (regulation)\n1416lb/642kg"

The Bahrain Grand Prix saw another\npoor qualifying session for both Lotus drivers, but as team\nprincipal Eric Boullier had expected, the car had better\nrace pace and both drivers subsequently finished\non the podium.\nThrough the mid-season Räikkönen continued to run\nstrongly scoring six more podiums but ultimately another\nwin eluded him. Grosjean really came into form and his\nlast six races of the season provided five points finishes\nwith four podiums. After having led for 26 laps in Japan\n(finishing third) he took a terrific second in the USA GP\nat Austin, tantalisingly close to a first GP victory.\nBy the time the teams arrived for the 17th round of\nthe championship in Abu Dhabi, Kimi Räikkönen\nannounced that he would be undergoing back surgery and would miss the final two races\nof the season. Despite initial speculation suggesting that Michael Schumacher would\nreplace him for the United States and Brazilian Grand Prix races, his place was taken by\none of the other two Finnish drivers in Formula 1 at the time Heikki Kovalainen. Having\ndriven the Team Lotus Type 128 in 2011, Kovalainen at least came to the team with a\nLotus connection of sorts. Grosjean who took another second in Austin retired from the\nfinal race in Brazil, while Kovalainen could only manage a 14th place finish at both of\nhis two races for Lotus F1. All in all, fourth in the Constructors’ title for Lotus F1 was\na remarkable result for the team from Enstone."

The package brought the sports car new\nstyling inside and out, as well as several new\ntechnical features.\n2013\nThe Evora Sports Racer could be ordered in both\nnaturally-aspirated and supercharged versions. In\nnaturally-aspirated format the 3.5-litre, DOHC V6\nengine delivered 276bhp, whilst in the supercharged\nedition this increased to 345bhp at 7,000rpm and\n295lbft of torque at 4,500rpm.\nAccording to the official announcement the new\nEvora Sports Racer as delivered, “Proves its value on\nthe pocket, as well as on the road and track – it delivers\nphenomenal performance, exclusive style, incredible\nexcitement and genuine affordability.” On the British\nmarket the car was priced at £57,900 for the naturally\naspired version (around $94,300 at the time) and £65,900\n($107,300) for the supercharged edition.

        "content": "Following an eventful season of both ups and downs that\nhad started with Kimi Raikkonen’s victory in the\nAustralian Grand Prix and ended with considerable\nconcerns of the team’s financial future, Lotus F1 faced the\nalmost herculean task of creating a brand new car built to\na completely revised set of regulations for 2014. These\nincluded the introduction of a complicated turbo and\nhybrid drivetrain as well as more subtle changes to the\naero regulations that prompted the adoption of a\ndistinctive new nose.\nFirst revealed to the public at the pre-season test in\nBahrain on the 19th of February, just hours after it was\nannounced that Lotus team principal Eric Boullier has\nstepped down, the new Lotus, dubbed E22 featured\nconventional front and rear suspension with, as in the\nprevious two seasons, push-rod actuated dampers at the\nfront and pull-rods at the rear.\nOver the past few years and in efforts to improve aero\nefficiency, Formula 1 designers had gradually developed\nraised noses but, for safety reasons, the new regulations\nfrom the FIA stipulated the use of a lower nose. This\nresulted in some very unusual creations, of which the\nLotus F1 two-fingered configuration was probably the\nmost unusual. Sure to prove controversial, the car’s new\nsplit-nose design was designed by Lotus to meet the new\nregulations dictating that the front wings were 150mm\nnarrower. Although initial concerns over its legality were\nraised, it was deemed to meet the regulations.\nThe chassis was designed by Nick Chester, Chris\nCooney, Martin Tolliday and Nicolas Hennel, with\nRenault again supplying the team’s powertrain. The E22\nwas designed to use Renault’s all-new, 1.6-litre, 24-valve\nV6 turbocharged engine, the Energy F1-2014. This would\nbe the last car from the Enstone-based team to use\nRenault engines before a new one-year deal with fellow\nDaimler brand Mercedes came in to force for 2015.\nThe team’s troubled financial situation which was\nprimarily responsible for the late start to the E22s build\nprogram meant the team was forced to miss the first pre-\nseason test at Jerez de la Frontera, but they did release\ncomputer-rendered images of the car in the week\nbeforehand, showing that distinctive asymmetrical forked\nnose design. After Kimi Räikkönen left the team at the\nend of the 2013 season to rejoin Ferrari, for 2014 the\nE22s would be driven by Romain Grosjean and Pastor\nMaldonado, who would join bringing sponsorship from\nPDVSA.\nAfter disappointing results in the first few races, the\ncar picked up pace when the season came to Europe, with\nRomain Grosjean qualifying fifth and coming home in\neighth position at the Spanish Grand Prix. Lotus\nnevertheless struggled to earn points throughout the\nseason, with only two more point-scoring finishes at\nMonaco for Grosjean and in the United States for\nMaldonado. The team would admit that a fundamental\nFormula 1\nE22\ndesign flaw on the chassis was hugely responsible for the poor performance during the\nseason. Thus, the team halted development of the car relatively early to concentrate on\nthe E23 chassis after developments on the troublesome car brought no improvements to\nits performance. Therefore, Lotus ended the season a disappointing eighth in the\nConstructors’ Championship standings, compared to fourth in 2013.\nMODEL\nLotus E22\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2014\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nRenault Energy F1-2014, V6 Turbo with kinetic and heat ERS\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1600cc/600bhp (ICE) +160bhp (ERS)\nLENGTH-WIDTH-HEIGHT mm/in\n5088/200.3 - 1800/70.8 - 950/37.4\nWHEELBASE\n3100mm/122.05in\nWEIGHT (regulation)\n1523lb/691kg"

It was ground\nbreaking when it was launched and continues to be the\nbenchmark for handling and performance in its class.\nOver the years we have improved and refined the Elise\nbut we have also ensured that we have retained the purity\nof the driving experience and for the Elise to remain as\nthe sports car to which other marques aspire.”\nThe lightweight (just 914kg, and 10kg less than the\nElise S,) aero-optimised, composite bodied Elise 20th\nAnniversary, was powered by a 1.8-litre supercharged\nengine. It reached 0-62mph (0-100kph) in 4.6 seconds and\nhad a top speed of 145mph. The major benefit of this\nlight weight is that the Elise 20th Anniversary consumed\njust 5.9-litres/100km (47.6mpg) and emitted just 173g of\nCO2 per km. The sport mode was also included as\nstandard fitment, and this increased throttle response and\naltered the traction slip thresholds allowing the driver\nenhanced control before intervention.\nCompared to the Elise S, a host of additional\nequipment came as standard and was designed to reduce\nweight. Items fitted as standard including lightweight\nmatt-black forged wheels, lightweight centre console in\nbody colour and lightweight sports seats in leather or\nAlcantara, with colour coded stitching. Four classic Elise\nbody colours were available (Blue, Green, Yellow and\nSilver) and the rear diffuser, wing mirrors, roll hoop cover\nand rear transom were all coloured matt-black. Elise 20th\nAnniversary decals inside on the dashboard and seats\nand outside above the side indicator identify the\nanniversary special edition.\nAs all this additional equipment amounted to £5,150\nworth of extra value, for only £2,700 more than the\nstandard Elise S at £37,200, the Elise 20th Anniversary\nsoon became an investment for the future.\nOptional extras included a colour-coded hardtop\nat £1,200, air conditioning at £1,250, and a CD/radio\nand USB Connection and NVH Pack for £1,200.\nIn addition to the Elise, the Lotus small platform\ntechnology has been used to great success in the Lotus\nExige, Lotus Europa and Lotus 2-Eleven models, all of\nwhich are, or have been manufactured by Lotus at its\nHeadquarters in Hethel, Norfolk.\nFuel consumption for Elise 20th Anniversary was\nquoted at 27.3mpg –10.3-litres/100km urban, 47.6mpg –\n5.9 litres/100km extra urban, and 37.5mpg –7.5 litres/\n100km combined.\n2015\nWith a total of almost 32,000 units built and sold\nglobally, Lotus celebrated 20 years of the most\nsuccessful Lotus ever, the Lotus Elise, with a\ncelebratory 20th Anniversary Special Edition.\nBased on the concepts of the Elise S Club\nRacer, and replacing the Elise S in the Lotus\nmodel range the lightweight 20th anniversary\nmodel employed classic Elise colour schemes.\nElise 20th Anniversary\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise 20th Anniversary\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2015\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n141\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, 4-cylinder Toyota VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/217bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150.5in/67.5in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,015lb/914kg\n272"

        "content": "2015\nFormula 1\nE 23\nOn 5 July 2014, Lotus F1 announced that\nthe E23 car under development for the 2015\nseason would be switching to Mercedes power.\nAlthough this change ended the team’s\nassociation with Renault, drivers Romain\nGrosjean and Pastor Maldonado remained\nwith the team.\nThe first images of the E23 were released to the press on January 26th and the\nfirst car was fired up at the Lotus F1 Team base in Enstone in the evening of Saturday\n31st January. The car was immediately packed and left for pre-season testing at Jerez,\nalthough while other teams started running on 1 February, Lotus arrived late, and\nmanaged to debut their car on track on 2 February, ahead of the team’s expectations.\nOne of most noticeable features of the E23 was the roll hoop duct arrangement.\nAlongside and slightly below the conventional inlet for combustion air there were two\nextra ducts, initially, the purpose of these was unclear to observers, it soon became\napparent that they feed air to a heat exchanger mounted toward the rear of the\nMercedes power unit. A fourth much smaller duct below the main inlet area sat\ndirectly behind the drivers’ helmet. The overall the design of the E23 was very close\nin many areas to that of the E22.\nThe E23 Hybrid however, represented a massive step forward for the team and\nTechnical Director Nick Chester commented: “It’s no secret that we struggled with last\nyear’s car so we’ve targeted every area that caused us an\nissue. We’ve made strong progress in the wind tunnel as\nwell as in areas such as packaging and cooling. We expect\nthe E23 to perform far, far better than its predecessor. In\nterms of what’s new, obviously a massive change for us\nis a new Power Unit supplier. We made this change as\nit looked and looks to be the one area of the car which\ncould bring us the greatest performance gain. It’s not just\nperformance, but reliability and driveability as well as\npackaging and cooling too. The E22 did deliver good\nfigures in the wind tunnel, even if it was difficult to unlock\nits potential, so we’ve paid more attention to making the\ncharacteristics of the car more adaptable. In terms of the\nsuspension, we were delivered something of a blow last\nyear when the front-rear interconnected suspension was\noutlawed mid-season. The E23’s suspension design is\nspecific to the updated regulations so we’re not trying to\nupdate a system originally intended to work a different\nway. We learnt a lot in many areas of the car over the\ncourse of 2014 so there are many lessons, which have\nbeen applied. We know we’ve made a big step. We won’t\nknow how our car will fare in relative terms until we’re\nout in action at a Grand Prix, but we certainly expect\nto be much more competitive than last year.”\nAfter the team's dramatic slump in 2014, the 2015\nseason would mark a small improvement in form. The\nAustralian Grand Prix was disappointing start for the\nteam as by lap 2 both cars had retired. In Malaysia,\nGrosjean finished 11th but Maldonado again retired\ndue to brake problems and in China Grosjean finished\n7th, his and the team’s best result since the 2013 US GP\n.\nAs the team continued to slim down to get control of\ntheir cash flow, the atmosphere similarly went downhill\nas results failed to materialise. Repeatedly the team saw\nits drivers encounter mechanical issues, get involved in\ncrashes, and at two races they even crashed into each\nother. The highpoint of the season came at the Belgian\nGrand Prix, where Romain Grosjean scored the team’s\nonly podium finish of the 2015 season, coming third. The\nE23 would ultimately be good for just 78 points, giving\nLotus F1 sixth place in the Constructors’ Championship.\nOn 21 December 2015 it was officially confirmed\non the teams website that the Renault group had\nre-purchased the Enstone-based team and planed on\nentering the 2016 season as the official Renault factory\nteam. Renault appointed Jérôme Stoll as chairman and\nCyril Abiteboul as managing director and, once again\nthe Lotus name disappeared from Formula 1.\nMODEL\nLotus E23\nNAME/FORMULA\nFormula 1\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2015\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n4\nENGINE TYPE\nMercedes PU106B Hybrid, V6 Turbo\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1600cc/930bhp\nLENGTH-WIDTH-HEIGHT mm/in\n5088/200.3 - 1800/70.8 - 950/37.4\nWHEELBASE\n3000mm/118.11in\nWEIGHT (regulation)\n1548lb/702kg"

For drivers who were\nhoping to enjoy a more spirited drive, the gearshift\ncharacteristics were calibrated to reflect the dynamic\nsystem changes that were activated when the driver\nselected either ‘Sport’ or ‘Race’ mode. Optimised gear\nselection and response delivered quicker all-round\nperformance when the sportier experience was requested.\nJean-Marc Gales, Chief Executive Officer, Group\nLotus plc said, “By introducing a paddle-shift, we have\nexpanded the Exige product range to make it more\naccessible to customers worldwide. Now, customers who\nare more accustomed to two pedals and automatic\ntransmissions can enjoy the unbelievable performance\nand handling of the Exige S without compromise.”\nAfter exhaustive testing it was anticipated that\nExige S Automatic would exceed the manual variant in\nperformance, and in fact, when it went on sale in January\nthe Exige S with automatic transmission was as fast, if not\nfaster than its manual counterpart around the Hethel test\ntrack. With a 0-100kph sprint time of 3.9 seconds it was\nactually 0.1 seconds quicker than the Exige S manual.\nAutomatic transmission was available as a cost option\nto the Exige S and Exige S Roadster models in all markets\nwhere the Exige was on sale, sadly this didn’t include the\nUSA where an auto version has typically outsold the\nmanual shift option. Prices for UK customers was set at\n£2,000 including VAT and €2,185 in the rest of Europe\nexcluding local taxes.\nWith a power-to-weight ratio of 292bhp/tonne,\nthe usual stunning Lotus performance, and an even\nmore focused driving experience was made possible by\nincluding the 6-speed automatic gearbox option. The\nautomatic control panel with buttons for Park, Reverse,\nNeutral and Drive was integrated neatly into the centre\nconsole of the cockpit. Beautifully crafted, forged\naluminium, manual shift paddles located behind the\nsteering wheel cross-spokes, facilitated up shifts that took\njust 240 milliseconds, with rapid downshifts accompanied\nby a throttle-blip (when in Sport mode).\nIn both automatic and manual gearshift modes, the\nExige S provided the driver with a very rapid driving\nexperience. In Sport mode, throttle response was\nsharpened and the Lotus Dynamic Performance\nManagement (DPM) increased the traction slip thresholds\nallowing the driver even more vehicle control before an\nintervention was required. The system also opened the\nengine exhaust bypass valve at mid-to-high engine speeds.\nThe Optional Race Pack included Race mode, which\nreduced the intervention of the DPM further.\nJean-Marc Gales, CEO Group Lotus plc, stated:\n“Expanding the Exige range, with a new automatic\ngearbox, opens up a new market for those who prefer\nusing a paddle shift with the alternative of an automatic\ngearshift. We expect that the Exige S Automatic will\naccount for over a third of the total global sales for the\nExige S range as many drivers will appreciate the\ninvolvement of a manual paddle-shift and the\nconvenience of an automatic.”\nAided by the 345bhp, 3.5-litre, supercharged V6\nengine, the Exige S Automatic reached 60mph in 3.8\nseconds and 100mph came up in just over 9 seconds\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige S Automatic\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2015-16\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nnot available\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/345bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n159in/71in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2606lb/1182kg\nExige S Auto\nType 111\nbefore reaching a top speed of 162mph.

The Cup 360 was a\nlimited edition run of just 50 cars and each of these special Exige 360 Cup cars was\nfitted with a numbered Lotus Motorsport build plate.\nThis new model boasted an increase in power of 10bhp with freer flowing induction\nand a sports exhaust system, which combined with a low vehicle weight of 1130kg gave\nan incredibly pure driving experience.\nJean-Marc Gales commented: “The V6 Cup was a favourite amongst many\nknowledgeable customers with its incredible track performance and distinctive design.\nI am excited about the introduction of the new 360 Cup which moves the game forward\nwith striking new design features and performance upgrades that offer phenomenal\nability on road and track.”\nThe Exige 360 Cup used the track proven aero package from the Exige V6 Cup with\nan aerodynamically optimised front splitter, rear diffuser and wing. Together with the flat\nunderside these aerodynamic aids offered a not insubstantial 42kg of downforce at 100mph.\nUnder the louvered engine cover of the Exige 360 Cup was the same 3.5-litre,\nsupercharged V6 that powere the standard V6 Cup, but Lotus pushed it to 360 PS\n(355 horsepower) – a 10PS boost. Lotus milked these\nextra ponies from the Toyota-sourced V-6 by freeing up\nthe flow in its intake and exhaust systems.\nLike the V6 Cup that this model was based on, the\n360 Cup had an aluminum chassis, double-wishbone\nsuspension and two-way adjustable suspension for\nprecision handling. It also had four dynamic modes:\ndrive, sport, race, and off, as well as a launch control\noption for off-the-line acceleration.\nNew features for the Exige 360 Cup included a\nbespoke lightweight front access panel, new lightweight\nrear tailgate and louvered panel. The Exige 360 Cup also\nhad a distinctive design, updated grooved brake discs for\nimproved performance. The Motorsport Red wheels were\na dead giveaway, but there is also a subtle red line on the\ntop of the air intakes that broke things up a bit.\nAt the rear, the changes were even more obvious, as\nthe rear three-quarter angle above shows. A “360 Cup”\n2015\nLaunched in the summer of 2015 the new Exige\n360 Cup took what Lotus had begun with the\n2013 Lotus Exige V6 Cup, and pushed it further,\nwith some subtle visual updates and a mild\npower boost. The 360 Cup featured a revised\nmatte-black hood with twin nostrils, while\nMotorsport Red highlights appeared on the\nfront splitter and on the front access panel.\nAnd then there were those red wheels!\nExige Cup 360\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige Cup 360\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2015\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n50\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/345bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n159in/71in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,491lb/1,130kg\nbadge, a louvered engine cover, red spoiler uprights, a red\naccent on the top of the diffuser, and dual-exit, center-\nmounted exhaust all added to the distinctive look.\nThe Exige 360 Cup’s cabin had a few updates, but\nnothing even close to the exterior. The main updates\nincluded “360 Cup” embroidered SuedeTex seats and\ndashboard, and the numbered build plate. There were,\nhowever, a few options that could help spruce things up\na bit. These options included a red Alcantara interior,\nfire extinguisher, air-conditioning, four-point harnesses,\nadjustable anti-roll bars, Öhlins race dampers, electrical\ncut-off, FIA carbon seats, air conditioning and removable\nsteering wheel.\nThe Exige 360 Cup went on sale with prices starting\nat £62,995 including UK taxes, oddly enough, this was\nthe exact same price as the V6 Cup.

Its pioneering and advanced bonded\naluminium chassis was a market-leading technological\ninnovation at the time and over the years has improved\nand evolved and remains core to the Elise’s exceptional\nperformance to this day.\nBoth the new Elise Sport and Elise Sport 220\nbenefitted from a significant weight reduction of 10kg,\na result of the continued central design philosophy of\nLotus – ‘lighter, faster’ and the perpetual quest to reduce\nweight of all constituent parts and in some cases remove\nunnecessary parts altogether. Weighing just 866kg, the\nElise Sport set a benchmark that both enthusiasts and\nnewcomers to the brand found easy to fall in love with.\nLightweight, efficient and completely pure in its driving\nexperience, its handling and quickness in road holding\nremained, as ever, the envy of all its rivals.\nThe Elise Sport 220 represented the perfect blend\nof power and dynamism in a more focused performance\npackage. Weighing 914kg, with peak power of 217bhp,\n0-60mph was achieved in just 4.2 seconds, with a top\nspeed of 145mph possible. However, it was once again in\nthe area of vehicle dynamics that the Elise Sport 220\nexcelled, offering an even purer driving experience when\ncompared to the previous Elise S model, due largely to\nthe further weight-saving, aided in part by a new\nlightweight sports battery.\nThe option of lightweight sports seats in leather,\nAlcantara, or classic tartan trim, were a further sign of\nsports intentions.

It featured revised internals and\na switch that could be driver activated, which allowed the\nexhaust to flow more freely, reducing back pressure under\nhigher engine loads and where conditions allowed. The\nby-product was a unique supercar soundtrack through\nthe three-inch wider, central exiting exhaust pipe.\nA number of manual gearbox enhancements greatly improved shift quality including\na new clutch disc and a low inertia flywheel that ensured swift and tactile gearchanges.\nFor the automatic transmission option, a new shift strategy was developed, and for the\nmanual version, a Torsen type limited slip differential (LSD) was now fitted to the rear\naxle as standard. This gave a more involved drive and better traction, that helped to\nproduce better lap times everywhere the cars was tested.\nNew, larger and more powerful brakes helped the Evora 400 cope with the increased\nspeeds brought on by the newly found power. Braking came from new, more powerful,\ntwo-piece, cross-drilled and ventilated brake discs were 370x32mm front and 350x32mm\nrear. Earlier Evora models had used 350x32mm front and 332x26mm rear.\nThe final piece of the puzzle was new lightweight forged aluminium wheels,\n(19-inch front and 20-inch rear). These were a full 3.3kg lighter than the forged wheels\non the previous Evora and were shod with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres (235/35x19\n91Y front; 285/30x20 99Y rear).\nThe exterior design of the Evora 400 exuded its supercar status. A new front-end\nincluded a purposeful front end design that incorporated larger cooling apertures. The\nnew rear end had new rear bumper, a lightweight composite rear diffuser, and three-\nelement rear wing. The overall effect was a car with a more aggressive stance, one that\nappeared lower and wider despite no actual increase in width compared with the\nprevious Evora. The overall length increased to 173-inches.\nHead of Design at Group Lotus, Russell Carr, was adamant about providing the new\nEvora 400 with a unique signature. “We were certain that a more focused and purposeful\nfrontal aspect was essential for a modern supercar,” he outlines. “However, we were also\nsure that to alter greatly the profile of the recognisable, award-winning, mid-engined\nEvora design would have been wrong intrinsically.\nA comprehensive round of changes resulted in a new interior for the Evora 400,\nnew front seats were lighter (by 3kg each) and provided greater support. The high-tech\naluminium bonded and extruded chassis was redesigned to improve both entry to and\nexit from the new Evora 400’s cockpit. The sills were 43mm narrower and 56mm lower\nthan previously and ingress, egress and cockpit space were much improved by narrower\ninner panels."

        "content": "At its launch in early 2016 the Lotus 3-Eleven was the\nmost powerful road car to have ever worn a Lotus badge\nand certainly Hethel’s quickest ever road car. It joined the\nranks of those rare cars that can reach 60mph in less than\nthree seconds and 100mph in six seconds. To complement\nthese figures, the 3-Eleven possessed a purity of the\ndriving experience and the benchmark handling for\nwhich all Lotus cars are renowned, enabling a lap of the\nchallenging Hethel circuit to be completed in 1 minute\n19.5s for the race specification version of the 3-Eleven.\nWith lightweight carbon-composite bodywork as\nstandard, the 3-Eleven had a dry weight of 890kg and\nmaximum power of 460bhp in the ‘Race’ version. It had\na more than enviable power to weight ratio of 517bhp per\ntonne, and was capable of sprinting from 0 to 60mph in\n2.9 seconds, boasting a maximum speed of 180mph. The\n‘Road’ version with a dry weight of 925kg and a\nmaximum power of 410bhp reached 60mph in 3.3\nseconds before attaining a top speed of 174mph. The\nlightweight Lithium-ion motorsport battery fitted on both\nthe Road and Race cars saved an additional 10kg over\nthe typical type of lightweight battery used on the rest\nof the Lotus range.\nAs the 3-Eleven was undergoing a full test and\ndevelopment period, Marc Basseng, Lotus 3-Eleven test\ndriver stated, “The 3-Eleven is the perfect car for a fast\nlap at the Nürburgring and is a sub-seven-minute car in\nfavourable conditions; a time like this puts the 3-Eleven\nfirmly into hypercar territory and I cannot wait to\ndrive the production version in a few months.”\nPrices started at £82,500 for the Road version\n(including UK tax and on the road costs) and £97,083\nexcluding UK tax for the Race version (£116,500\nincluding VAT). The 3-Eleven was to be sold in all\nmarkets as a racecar and in Europe and Asia as both\na race car and a fully legalised street car.\nThe aggressive stance and dramatically sculpted\nlightweight carbon composite body on both Road and\nRace versions perfectly balanced the competition focus of\na track car with the surface refinement of a road-going\nsupercar. In keeping with performance orientated design,\nan optional Carbon Tonneau Cover was available for\nboth Road and Race versions. In either left or right hand\ndrive configurations, the removable aerodynamic cover\nefficiently smoothed the airflow over the cockpit and\nturned the car into a competition inspired single seater.\nAs expected for such a focussed and extreme a sports\ncar, the 3-Eleven was capable of delivering high levels of\naerodynamic downforce from the sculptured bodywork,\nrear wing, front splitter and flat floor and rear splitter. At\n150mph the Road version produced 150kg of downforce;\nthe Race version with its additional twin front canards\nmounted on both sides and its adjustable rear wing\nproduced a massive 215kg of downforce. Not only\n2016\nUnveiled at the 2015 Goodwood Festival of\nSpeed in July, production of the ultra exclusive\nLotus 3-Eleven, which was originally intended to\nbe limited to a run of 311 vehicles, began in\nearly 2016. With the first cars being delivered to\ncustomers in March that year, the 3-Eleven was\nto be sold in all markets as a track-only race\ncar, although in Europe and Asia it would be\navailable in both road car and race car editions.\n3-Eleven\nType 123\n280"

Delivered to the marque’s now\nfamous ‘Lightweight Laboratory’, it emerged with a range\nof features, including a Lithium-ion battery which slashed\n10kg off the weight, carbon-fibre seats, reducing the\nweight by 6kg, and ultra-lightweight forged alloy wheels,\nsaving a further 1.5kg.\nGoing on sale in all major markets (excluding North\nAmerica) from April 2016, the Lotus Elise Cup 250 was\nnow available for the first time as a roadster as standard\nwith a hard top available as an option. For those wanting\nto cut the car’s weight still further, and so boost\nperformance, a Carbon Aero Pack was also available,\nwhich cut an extra 10kg, reducing the mass to just 921kg.\nWith the new car lapping the company’s Hethel test\ntrack in 1 minute 34 seconds, the changes and engineering\nadaptions to the Elise Cup 250 had taken an impressive\nfour seconds off the previous Elise Cup 220’s best time\nand represented the fastest recorded lap time for a\nproduction Elise.\nThe new Elise Cup 250 benefitted from the\ncontinuous improvement design philosophy of Lotus\nand its perpetual quest to evolve all constituent parts,\nlightening and optimising them. Every aspect of the car\nwas carefully considered: from the recalibrated ignition\nsystem, right down to the wider 195/50 R16 front tyres\nto give sharper, more-responsive steering. Powered by\na new higher-output version of the supercharged, 1.8-litre\n4-cylinder engine, the Elise Cup 250 boasted 243bhp\nat 7200rpm and 250Nm of torque between 3500rpm\nand 5500rpm.\nLotus Dynamic Performance Management (DPM)\nprovided a ‘Sport’ mode, increasing throttle response,\nlowering traction slip thresholds and removing understeer\nrecognition.

        "content": "2016\nAnnounced in December of 2015 and available from early 2016, the\nreplacement for the Exige S and the ultimate incarnation Lotus’ mid-engined\nV6 coupé, the Sport 350 was lighter and faster than the Exige S and the next\nstep on Lotus CEO Jean-Marc Gales’ ladder to recovery for Lotus. As the\nExige had always been inherently ‘right’ and therefore had fewer areas that\nrequired attention, the Exige Sport 350 didn’t undergo such a comprehensive\nupdate as the Evora had done to become 400. The initial plan had been to fit\nthe Evora’s 400bhp engine to the Exige, but in doing so it would have meant\nthe engineers couldn’t get the car below the 1200kg target weight set by\nGales. Therefore it was weight loss that was the key focus, with 51kg taken\nout of the car reducing the kerb weight to 1125kg.\nThe Exige Sport 350 retained the 3.5-litre, 345bhp Toyota-sourced\nsupercharged V6 fitted to the Exige S, but what did change was the manual\nsix-speed gearbox. The gearbox’s shift mechanism was thoroughly\noverhauled with a new mechanism designed to provide a tighter, more\nprecise and cleaner shift action which some had felt was as issue on the\nstandard Exige. The Exige Sport 350 was the first Lotus to feature the new\nlightweight, exposed aluminium manual gear shift mechanism something\nwhich soon became a welcome feature in every Elise and Exige. The\nmechanism’s new components were machined from cast aluminium and\nresulted in a 1.5kg saving. The six-speed automatic gearbox introduced\nearlier in 2015 was also available on the Sport 350.\nDespite no additional power from the V6 engine, the Sport 350 was\na tenth quicker to 60mph, stopping the clock in 3.7 seconds. Top speed\nremained at 170mph and it lapped the Hethel test track 2.5 seconds faster\nthan the Exige S, setting a 1min29.8sec, the first production Lotus to\nget below 1min 30sec.\nAs you might expect, there was a back-story\nto the “adding Lightness” aspect of the Sport 350.\nThe previous summer, Lotus took an Exige S\napart and had students weigh the parts. They then\ngot engineers, line-assembly staff and suppliers\nto suggest ways to add the famous Lotus\nlightness, also improving the effectiveness and\nquality of component design. The exercise yielded\nover 120 ideas many of which which went into\ncreating the Sport 350.\nChanges include a louvered composite engine\ncover to replace the previous glass item (-6.6lbs),\na new battery and mounting bracket (-7.7lbs),\nlighter body panels (-26.5lbs), removing some\nsound deadening (-6lbs), replacing the handbrake\n(-0.57lb!), and deleting the sun visors and the\npassenger foot rest (-2.6lbs). The Exige was even\nhomologated without air-conditioning, shaving\n16.5lbs, but to be honest, this would probably be\nadded back as an option on most cars sold!\nExige Sport 350\nType 111\nIt was enough for the Sport 350 to lap the\nLotus test track at Hethel in 1:29.8 sec, 2.5 seconds\nfaster than the Exige S – particularly impressive\nbecause the time was set on optional Pirelli\nTrofeo tyres, no longer road legal, where the Sport\nlapped on less sticky P-Zero Corsas. The tyres\nwere 205/45 R17s front, 265/35 R18s rear, the latter\nstretched over half-inch wider rims.\nThe Sport 350 programme focused on weight\nloss and with lower mass the engineers could also\nfocus on fine tuning the chassis further. Camber,\ntoe and bump-steer were all changed, the toe\nangle to allow a degree of pre-load in the tyres\n(a Pirelli P Zero Corsa, or Trofeo R if you were\ntrack focused) to eliminate the nervousness the\nExige suffered on less than perfect surfaces. The\nsteering rack was also repositioned and the rear\nwheels were half an inch wider at 10-inches.\nThere was also a new lightweight forged wheel\nthat saved 5kg of unsprung weight."

With a\nsupercharged engine, a 0-60mph time of 3.9 seconds,\nand a unique, hand-finished interior, it perfectly defined\nthe quintessential British sportscar in this celebration year\nfor the marque.\nAs an antidote to sterilised and staid modern cars, the\nLotus approach continued to deliver the purest, undiluted\ndriving experience. Tipping the scales at just 899kg,\nthrough the utilisation of advanced materials including\ncarbon-fibre and aluminium, the Elise 250 Special\nEdition remained true to the company’s philosophy of\n‘Light is Right’ and is capable of humbling far more\ncommon, yet expensive, rivals.\nPowered by the now familiar, high-output, Toyota\nderived supercharged, 1.8-litre, 4-cylinder engine, the 250\nSpecial Edition boasted 243bhp at 7200rpm and 250Nm\nof torque between 3500rpm and 5500rpm. This, along\nwith the car’s low kerb weight, contributed to the\nimpressive 270bhp/tonne headline figure.\nHowever, far from being solely performance\norientated, the Elise 250 Special Edition was designed to\nappeal aesthetically as well as dynamically. A selection of\nbeautifully finished carbon-fibre components come as\nstandard, including a front splitter, rear wing, tailgate\nand front access panel, all giving the car considerable\nkerb appeal.\nLimited to just 50 examples, the Elise 250 Special\nEdition was available in choice of four colours, each a\nlong-standing favourite over the last 50 years. Classic\nmetallic blue, red, yellow and white finishes were all\ncomplemented by ultra-light forged wheels in silver,\nor black as an option. An optional carbon-fibre hardtop\nroof panel was also available.\nThe same attention to detail continued inside, with\nthe carbon-fibre sports seats finished in either dark blue\nor dark grey leather, and stitched with a choice of\ncontrasting colours.

        "content": "The Evora Sport 410 was to be limited to a global\nproduction run of just one hundred and fifty vehicles per\nyear, and went on sale in Europe in mid-2016 and the rest\nof world markets at the end of 2016. An adapted version\nof the Evora Sport 410 for the North American market\nwhich included a special black and gold ‘GP’ Edition,\nfollowed in the summer of 2017.\nThe result of thousands of hours of development by\nLotus, across every aspect of the car, from the mass of\ncarbon-fibre components covering the car from nose to\ntail as standard, including a revolutionary one-piece\ntailgate, to the recalibrated and tuned supercharged\nV6 engine – every inch of the Sport 410 was assessed\nto provide unrivalled performance.\nDesigned to deliver both on track and on the road,\nthe Sport 410 was truly formidable. The car’s vastly\nimproved aerodynamic configuration delivered an\nunparalleled level of handing and high-speed stability, and\nthe addition of performance orientated wheels, tyres and\ncritical parts, including the new titanium exhaust, ensures\nthat it drew on Colin Chapman’s obsession with lightness.\nHowever, far from a stripped-out track special, the new\nmodel retained excellent road manners, remaining refined\nand composed on B-roads.\nKey to the cut in weight, by more than 70kg, was the\nadoption of hand-made carbon-fibre components. Rather\nthan just replacing existing parts with lighter versions,\neach was redesigned and enhanced in order to make the\nmost of the composite’s properties. Covering the car from\nfront to back, these included front splitter, revised front\naccess panel, roof section, tailgate, rear quarter panels,\nand rear diffuser. These were joined by race-derived\ncarbon sports seats, which themselves saved 9kg each.\nIn addition to boosting acceleration, the car’s dry\nweight of just 1,270kg (1,280 kg without the optional\ntitanium exhaust or 1291kg for the automatic version)\nresulted in sharper and more intuitive handling. Lowering\nthe centre of gravity demanded the recalibration of the\nsuspension – with an improved geometry and revised\nsetup. The re-valved dampers provided an increase in\ncompression and rebound, while the effective rise in\nspring rate and a reduction in ride height by 5mm all\nprovide better body and roll control, yet ride comfort\nand composure are retained. Inspired by some of Lotus’\nmost-famous heritage models, the one-piece carbon\ntailgate incorporated a louvered section which, together\nwith carbon rear quarter panels, helped provide the car\nwith a sleek, fastback silhouette. However, the benefits of\nthis were far more than aesthetic. A significant chunk of\nthe development time was spent honing the car’s\naerodynamic performance. The use of the new carbon\ncomponents, and the careful modelling of air flow over\nand under the sculptured bodywork effectively doubled\ndownforce, up to 64kg, yet resulted in a slightly lower\ndrag coefficient overall. Increasing stability at high speeds,\ncemented the Evora’s reputation as a genuine supercar\nand it joined a select group that could genuinely exceed\n190mph yet remain tractable.\nDeveloped as part of the Lotus 3-Eleven project, the\nEvora Sport 410’s engine was a higher-output version of\nthe supercharged, 3.5-litre, 6-cylinder unit, producing\n410bhp at 7000rpm and 420Nm of torque at 3500rpm.\nUtilising an integrated water-to-air charge cooler, it\nunderwent many hours of development and testing,\nincluding performance evaluation at the infamous\nNürburgring Nordschleife circuit.\nAs befitted a car of such capability, the Evora Sport\n410 was equipped with bespoke, ultra-lightweight forged\naluminium wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres.\nThe 10-spoke forged aluminium wheels reduced\nun-sprung mass and were produced specifically to work\nwith the Sport 410, while the addition of the high-\nperformance Michelin tyres help provide detailed\ndriver feedback and outstanding traction.\n2016\nAfter an intense development programme,\nthe Evora Sport 410 was officially released in\nFebruary of 2016. Massively lighter, with more\npower and huge gains in aerodynamic efficiency,\nthis new generation of Evora was a pure-bred\nsupercar, using Lotus’ DNA to deliver a spiritual\nsuccessor to the marque’s most iconic models,\nincluding the 1992 Esprit Sport 300.\nEvora Sport 410\nType 122\nMODEL\nType 122\nNAME/FORMULA\nEvora Sport 410\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2016-18\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n150 per year\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/410bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173in/72.5in/47in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,800lb/1,270kg (dry)\n290"

        "content": "High powered, highly evolved, and ferociously fast, the\nLotus Exige Sport 380 was certainly the most aggressive\niteration yet for the Exige model line up. The new, top-of-\nthe-range model carried over the lessons learnt in the\ndevelopment of the Exige Sport 350, launched in 2015,\nbut with significant revisions lowering weight, boosting\npower and enhancing aerodynamics.\nRather than relying excessively on electronics, or\nallow sterile interfaces to dull the experience, the Exige\nSport 380 offered a pure, undiluted drive that had to be\nexperienced to be fully appreciated. The new Exige was\nblisteringly fast off the line, dispatching 0-60mph in 3.5\nseconds before reaching a top speed of 178mph.\nFrom the intricately engineered exposed-gear-change\nlinkage, to the swathes of carbon-fibre components and\nMichelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres as standard, every inch\nof the Exige was carefully cultivated. Firmly defined as\na Lotus for the enthusiast, the car could be seen as an\nexpression of intense engineering - challenging any\naccomplished drivers to extract the car’s true potential.\nWhile employing some of the high-performance\ncomponents premiered on the Exige Sport 350, Lotus\nonce again returned to their Lightweight Laboratory in\norder to cut kilos from the kerb weight. Infused with\ncarbon-fibre from front to back, the Sport 380 featured\nhand-made, high-gloss visible weave components as\nstandard to deliver a weight saving when compared to the\nExige Sport 350. This included the front splitter, revised\nfront access panel, new rear wing and rear diffuser\nsurround, which together save 2.7kg. A lightweight,\ntransparent polycarbonate rear window saved 0.9kg over\nthe glass equivalent in the Exige Sport 350. Additional\nsavings which added up to a massive 26.3kg were found\nthrough, carbon race seats (6kg), a lithium ion battery\n(10.3kg), ultra-lightweight forged wheels and grooved\ntwo-piece brake discs (10kg).

        "content": "The company’s powertrain division also left its mark\non the new car, with an uprated version of the 3.5-litre,\nsupercharged V6 engine generating 375bhp at 6,700rpm\nand 410Nm (302lbft) of torque at 5,000rpm. Refined\nfrom extensive testing and development, it was a design\nthat proved its mettle by also powering the track-focused\n3-Eleven and the recently revealed Evora Sport 410.\nThe power boost came from a revised supercharger\npulley, which increased charge pressure, an uprated fuel\npump, a recalibrated ECU and the introduction of a\nrevised exhaust system – as used in the Evora 400 and\nEvora Sport 410. Allowing owners to enjoy the new\nExige for longer between fuel stops, it also come with\nan enlarged, 48-litre petrol tank. Providing faster, cleaner\nchanges, the Exige Sport 380’s six-speed manual gearbox\nused the Lotus acclaimed open-gate design. Eliminating\nlateral movement, by precisely aligning components, it\nfeatured lightweight machined and cast aluminium parts.\nAesthetically appealing, the open transmission mechanism\nalso helped contribute to the car’s reduced weight. The\nmanual gearbox was been further enhanced through\nthe introduction of a new oil cooler, ensuring the gears\noperate at the optimal temperature no matter how hard\nthey are performing.\nThe Exige Sport 380 was also available with an\noptional six-speed automatic gearbox, where drivers could\nselect gears sequentially via the forged aluminium paddles\nlocated behind the steering wheel, or rely on the gearbox’s\nfully automatic mode. When the car was launched in\nNovember of 2016, the automatic gearbox option was\nset to become available from the spring of 2017.\nExtensive CFD modelling work allowed the Lotus\ndesign team to fine-tune the aerodynamic efficiency in\norder to deliver a substantial overall improvement. The\nrevised front access panel modified the air flow exiting the\ncar’s horizontally mounted radiators, before it travelled\nover the car, while the carbon front spoiler and rubber lip\nspoiler combined with the carbon barge boards reduced\npressure under the vehicle. In addition, twin pairs of front\ncanard wings, mounted forward of the front wheels, a\ncarbon rear wing and air blades behind the rear wheels,\nall worked to help raise downforce to a massive 140kg at\nmaximum speed - a sixty percent gain over the Exige\nSport 350, which generated 88kg at its maximum speed.\nThis increase in downforce did not come at the penalty of\ndrag, which remained the same as the Exige Sport 350.\nMaking the most of its performance potential, the\nExige Sport 380 was fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport\nCup 2 tyres as standard (265/35 ZR18 rear and 215/45 ZR17 front). Selected for their\ntenacity, and 10mm wider at the front than on the Exige Sport 350, the increased\nmechanical grip was complemented by the car’s ultra-lightweight forged alloy wheels,\nwhich were available in either black or silver. Either option was backed up by AP Racing\nforged, four-piston brake calipers and grooved performance two-piece brake discs.\nOpting for the full exhaust system in titanium improves the car’s overall balance, by\nremoving 10kg from beyond the rear axle. For customers who frequently go to the track,\nthe optional Track Pack provides Nitron two-way adjustable dampers and Eibach\nadjustable front and rear anti-roll bars. The optional Carbon Exterior Pack contained a\none-piece carbon roof panel and a distinctive carbon louvered tailgate. The carbon roof\npanel was 2kg heavier than the standard soft-top but this weight increase is offset by the\ncarbon louvered tailgate, which saved 2kg.\nAs befitting such a stand-out car, the Exige Sport 380 was sprayed and hand finished\nin one of ten individual colours. The car’s kerb appeal was enhanced by revisions to the\nExige’s design front and back. Distinctive blackened headlamp surrounds provided a\nmore aggressive demeanour, whilst to visually accentuate the width of the rear of the\ncar, a new rear transom features two lamp clusters rather than four.\nAt the end of 2016 Lotus announced that 2017 would see the appearance of the\nExige Race 380 - a track-only sibling of what had been hailed as one of the marque’s\nmost significant and sensational cars, the Exige Sport 380. Taking one of the world’s best\nsupercars, the new model provided the ultimate in race-bred engineering and came with\na host of competition-focused components as standard.\nDeveloped to be eligible for the world-wide Lotus Cup series as well as a number of\nclubman championships and in keeping with its name, the new Exige Race 380 included\na wide range of competition-orientated options as standard, covering everything from\ndrivetrain to driver information systems – all designed to increase the car’s capabilities.\nRetaining the race-proven 3.5-litre supercharged V6 engine, the Exige Race 380\nboasted 375bhp at 6,700rpm and 410Nm (302 lbft) of torque at 5,000rpm. However,\nin order to extract every ounce of performance, the car came with an Xtrac 6-speed\nsequential transmission (operated by carbon paddles located behind the steering wheel),\noil cooler, and cassette-type plate limited slip differential. Opting for the full exhaust\nsystem in titanium removed a further 10kg from beyond the rear axle. Extremely quick\noff the line, the Exige Race 380 could sprints from 0-60mph in just 3.2 seconds, and lap\nthe Hethel track in an outstanding 1 minute 23.5 seconds - the fastest ever for an Exige.\nThe Exige Race 380 also featured a full, integrated roll cage, lightweight FIA\nCarbon driver seat (HANS compatible) and a six-point harness, as well as ultra-\nlightweight polycarbonate side windows, a competition specification fire extinguisher,\nbattery isolator and front and rear motorsport towing eyes.

Featuring a host of\nweight-saving items as standard, as well as distinctive new\nstyling, the new Lotus of course remained true to the\ncompany’s founding principles. Benefitting the range as a\nwhole, the new Elise editions received the 2016MY car’s\nnew look and new interior options, and every one of the\nSprint’s lightweight components could be specified on\nthe standard and the 220 variants.\nEnsuring that this latest Elise remained true to the\ncompany’s DNA, the return for the Sprint badge – as\nused on historic models including the Elan in the mid-\nseventies and the Éclat in the eighties – was designed to\nprovide a highly attractive super lightweight option sitting\nabove the respective Elise Sport models, and below the\ntop of the range Elise Cup 250. In the biggest weight cut\nto the car since the introduction of the first-generation\nElise in 1996, Lotus returned to its roots by employing\nthe same intense engineering strategy as used on its\nmost recent models.\nIntegrating a new front and rear aesthetic with\nLotus’ established design language, this latest Elise also\nreceived a wide range of cabin enhancements – including\nthe lightweight open-gate gear select mechanism first\nintroduced on the Lotus Exige Sport 350. The new Elise\nSprint was available in two engine options: the 1.6-litre or\nthe supercharged 1.8-litre. Offering 134bhp/160Nm of\ntorque and 217bhp/250Nm of torque respectively, they\nhave been specifically tuned to suit the Elise and both help\nto deliver a benchmark power-to-weight ratio and class\nleading efficiency. Being so lightweight, emissions were\nextremely low with 149g/km CO2 and 173g/km CO2\nfor the 1.6 engine and 1.8 engines respectively.\nThe Sprint’s standard lightweight components\nincluded a Lithium-Ion battery, saving 9kg, Lotus’\nbeautifully detailed carbon race seats, 6kg, new\nlightweight forged alloy wheels, 5kg, while the carbon\naccess panel, roll hoop cover and engine cover, and\npolycarbonate rear screen saved 6kg. Collectively they cut\nan impressive 26kg, compared to the previous Sport and\nSport 220 models, and together with the improvements\nmade to the whole Elise range brought the weight of the\nnew Elise Sprint down to just 798kg (dry). This included\nnew, optional two-piece brake discs, saving 4kg, and\noptional carbon sill covers (0.8 kg). This reduction in\nweight translates into quicker acceleration (with 0-60mph\nin 5.9 seconds and 4.1 seconds for the Elise Sprint and\nElise Sprint 220 respectively), harder cornering and a\npower to weight ratio of up to 168bhp/tonne (Elise\nSprint) and 257bhp/tonne (Elise Sprint 220).\nExternal design touches for the Sprint range included\na matt-black transom panel, black wheels which came\nwith custom contrasting metal spun rims, distinctive yet\nsubtle side stripes on the bodywork and unique side and\nrear badging. Further enhancement could be specified,\nincluding a new paintwork colour: “Electric Light Blue”\nwhich joined the Lotus core colour range.\nOther highlights included bodywork keyed colour\ninserts for the sports seats, transmission console and\nHVAC surround, along with Sprint badge stitching.\nThe Sprint’s detailing continued inside with an array of\noptional Alcantara trim panels on the doors, sills, seats\nand vents surrounds, all with contrasting stitching.\nOptions for the new car included an Alcantara trimmed\nsteering wheel, vent-surrounds and sills.\n2017\nOnce again, the Elise continued to redefine\nwhat is possible in terms of adding lightness\nto a sports car. Whilst other manufacturers tried\nto keep pace, Lotus went ahead and raised the\nbar beyond their reach.

Key to the Exige Cup 380 reaching\nits low weight of 1,057kg was the comprehensive\nadoption of carbon-fibre and extreme engineering.\nExtremely quick off the line, the Exige Cup 380 lapped\nthe Hethel track in 1 minute 26 seconds – a record\nfor a road-legal Exige.\nMaking their first appearance on a road-going\nLotus, heavily revised bodywork elements contributed to\nthe increased downforce of the Exige Cup 380, with the\ncar generating up to 200kg, forty-three percent more\nthan the Exige Sport 380. To harness the huge hike in\ndownforce, and provide increased mechanical grip,\nwider 285/30 ZR18 rear tyres were required – a step\nup from the 265/35 ZR18 as fitted to the Sport 380.\nWith the two elements working in combination, this\nhuge boost in grip allowed the car to corner harder and\nfaster which, given with the Exige’s existing reputation\nas a driver’s car, elevated it to a whole new level.\nJean-Marc Gales, CEO, Group Lotus plc said,\n“Developing the Cup 380 has allowed us to indulge our\nmotorsport ambitions on a car that can be used and\nenjoyed every single day. This is an Exige that’s not just\nunbeatable point-to-point but also capable of winning\nhighly competitive races. The biggest surprise for many\nis that it’s fully road legal – a considerable achievement\nconsidering the car’s performance capabilities. Unlike\nsome rivals’ cars, this is something that really can drive to\na track, set the fastest lap and take the win, before heading\nhome. It’s supremely usable, yet outrageously fast.”\nAt the heart of the new Exige Cup 380 lay a\nconcept from the core of one of Lotus’ founding\nprinciples. With an unrivaled lineage, the new\nthoroughbred Lotus Exige Cup 380 was endowed\nwith race car sensibilities and road car manners.\nHoning the Exige Cup 380’s high speed abilities\nwas paramount in its development, and the inclusion\nof new wind tunnel developed aerodynamic elements\nallowed this road-going Exige to deliver up to 200kg\nof aerodynamic downforce at a top speed of 175mph.\nLocated over the wheels, the front louvers equalise\nthe pressure differential within the wheel arches,\nincreasing downforce at high speed and under hard\nbraking, whilst the cut-out sections behind the rear\nwheels work with the aero blades mounted either side\nof the race diffuser. Even the Exige’s windscreen wiper\nhas been aero tuned – now resting in a vertical position\nto avoid disrupting air flow.\nAn integral part of the car’s aerodynamic prowess,\nthe high-gloss, hand-made carbon-fibre components\ninclude new front splitter, front access panel,\nbargeboards, roof, diffuser surround, new larger\naperture air-intake side pods, a new one-piece tailgate\nand a straight-cut high efficiency motorsport derived\nrear wing.\nThe new design one-piece carbon rear tailgate reduced\nweight by 6.5kg and the removal of gas struts deletes 1kg.\nThe new carbon side pods saved a further 0.5kg.\n2017\nWithout equal and without compromise, the\nballistic new lightweight, 275bhp, Lotus Exige\nCup 380 coupé announced in April of 2017\nprovided the perfect balance between a fully\ntype approved road car, and genuine race car.\nOne able to deliver the ultimate track-and-back,\nstreet-legal Lotus.\nExige Cup 380\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige Cup 380\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2017\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n60\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/375bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n159in/71in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,330lb/1,057kg\n296"

        "content": "2017\nFollowing the successful introduction of the\nLotus Evora 400 and Evora Sport 410 to global\nmarkets, in July of 2017 Lotus unveiled its most\npowerful road-going model ever – the Evora\nGT430. The hand-crafted, carbon-fibre\ncomponents, endowed this fully homologated\nEvora with a level of precision engineering and\ndesign previously unseen from Hethel.\nEvora GT430\nType 122\nMODEL\nType 122\nNAME/FORMULA\nEvora GT430\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2017-18\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n60 max\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/430bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173in/72.5in/47in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,773lb/1,258kg (dry)\nThis focused evolution of the Evora resulted in a\nlandmark model for the Lotus. Powered by a new\ndevelopment of the 3.5-litre V6 supercharged and charge\ncooled engine producing 430bhp at 7,000rpm and\n440Nm (325lbft) of torque from 4,500rpm.\nThe increase in torque is facilitated through the\nintroduction of an air-to-liquid gearbox cooler as\nstandard, a feature which made its debut on the recently\nlaunched North American Evora 400. As standard, the\nEvora GT430 also features a titanium exhaust, cutting\n10kg from beyond the car’s rear axle and further\namplifying the car’s aural presence.\nAlso fitted as standard, the Evora GT430’s six-speed\nmanual gearbox featured a low inertia, single-mass\nflywheel, to help ensure swift changes, while a Torsen-type\nlimited slip differential (LSD) gave better traction, and\nfaster exit speeds, when cornering.\nUnderpinned by the company’s acknowledged\neminence in lightweight engineering, and at a new\nbenchmark weight of 1,258kg (dry), the Evora GT430\nwas the most powerful, accomplished the lightest Evora to\nhave ever come out of the Hethel facility. Zero to 60mph\ncould be dispatched in just 3.7 seconds and the car’s top\nspeed was 190mph (305kph).\nWith new and specifically designed body panels,\nfeaturing exposed carbon weave sections, front and rear,\nthe GT430 generated up to 250kg of downforce through\nadvanced aerodynamics. Benefitting from this significant\nhike in downforce, the Evora GT430 was a class apart\nfrom its competitors, although just 60 editions of this\nsupreme Evora were to be hand built, making it a true\ncollector’s car.\nLarger front apertures, a new carbon-fibre splitter, air\nblades and louvers positioned on top of each front wheel\narch clearly illustrated the supercar credentials of the\nEvora GT430 when viewed head on. At the rear, aero\nducts behind each wheel were designed to reduce pressure\nin the wheel arch and offer visibility of the wider Michelin\nPilot Sport Cup 2 tyres, and a large rear diffuser provided\na sharp visual finish. Both were crowned by the large,\nprofiled carbon wing.\nIn addition to the unique full carbon front and rear\nbumpers, which featured exposed visible weave sections,\nthe car was comprehensibly equipped with high-gloss,\nvisible carbon-fibre components throughout, including\na new front splitter, front access panel, roof panel and\nfull width rear wing. Also at the rear was a beautifully\ndetailed, one-piece carbon tailgate, incorporating a\nlouvered section, which, together with composite quarter\npanels, afforded the car an unmistakable profile.\nA new carbon-fibre front splitter cleanly separated\nand increased airflow speed under the car, and the two\nenlarged carbon-fibre front ducts, with integrated air\nblades, efficiently move air though to the front wheel\ncavities. All to help reduce turbulence and drag created by\nthe wheels themselves. The lightweight curved rear edges\nof the front wheel arch panels channelled air along the\nside of the car and the louvers positioned on top of each\nfront wheel arch reduced pressure above the wheel.\nThe rear of the Evora GT430 also received the same\nattention to detail, with the deep, sculpted ducts behind\neach wheel that vented airflow as quickly as possible from\nthe wheel arches, improving downforce. Dominating all\nof this was the large, high mounted aerodynamically\nefficient motorsport carbon wing.\nAll Lotus cars are regarded as the finest handling\nsports cars on the market and the new Evora GT430 took\ndynamic performance to the next level. Damping was\nprovided by Lotus-tuned, Öhlins TTX two-way\nadjustable units, with 20 click-adjustment compression\nand rebound settings and saving 10kg in mass compared\nto the Evora Sport 410 set-up."

Perfect for B-roads, but ballistically fast\nwhen needed, the new Evora GT430 could lap the Hethel\ntest track in 1 minute 25.8 seconds – a record for an\nEvora. As fast as the famed Lotus 3-Eleven road car on\nthe same circuit, the GT430’s performance envelope was\nderived from a combination of clever aero and dynamic\ndevelopments as well as outright power. As a result, the\ncar was manifest of Colin Chapman’s visionary quote:\n“\nAdding power makes you faster on the straights;\nsubtracting weight makes you faster everywhere.”\nTo harness the increased downforce and power,\nmechanical grip was provided by 10mm wider Michelin\nPilot Sport Cup 2 tyres, with 245/35 R19 at the front and\n295/30 R20 at the rear, on one-inch wider 10.5J rear\nwheels. Ultra-lightweight forged aluminium wheels were\nstandard, in either black or silver, with optional finishes\navailable in gloss red or a gloss black-machined rim design.\nThe Evora GT430 also included a newly developed\nvariable traction control function, linked directly to the\nECU, which allowed the amount of wheel slip to be set\nby the driver whilst in ‘Race/Off’ setting, with five pre-set\ntraction levels (1%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12% slip) and ‘Off’\ndisplayed via the instrument cluster.\nA fast car requires substantial stopping power, and the\nEvora GT430 used two-piece J-grooved and ventilated\nbrake discs at the front, paired with AP Racing four-piston calipers all round, while\nthe rear used three-piece discs with lightweight aluminium centres saving 2kg.\nThe external theme of carbon continued into the car’s exquisitely crafted cabin,\nwith visible-weave, handmade components as standard. These included Lotus’ beautifully\ndetailed carbon race seats, new carbon door sills, and a new lightweight carbon\ninstrument binnacle cover with a new design of graphic on the instrument panel. Newly-\ndesigned carbon-backed Sparco seats with a unique trim design could also be ordered,\nwhilst customers looking for a more race focused cabin can specify an optional driver\nand passenger four-point harnesses and titanium rear frame.\nThe steering wheel, dashboard, door panels, transmission tunnel and centre console\nwere all trimmed in a combination of black Alcantara and perforated leather, with a full\nleather or full Alcantara trim option available at no additional cost. All trim choices were\ncomplemented by contrast twin colour stitching, in red and white, and with matt-black\ninterior panels."

The Evora GT430 range continues this legacy,\ncombining our expertise in highly efficient engineering\nand aerodynamics with more power and torque to provide\none of the most rounded and rewarding driving\nexperiences on the road or track.”\nInside the cabin, the use of visible-weave, carbon\ncomposite components continued. These included Lotus’\nbeautifully detailed carbon race seats, new carbon door\nsills and a new lightweight carbon instrument binnacle\ncover with a new design of graphic on the instrument\npanel. The steering wheel, dashboard, door panels,\ntransmission tunnel and centre console were all trimmed\nin a combination of black Alcantara and perforated\nleather, complemented by contrast twin colour stitching,\nin red and white, and matt-black interior panels.\nAn integrated touch-screen infotainment system\ncould also be specified, including i-Pod connectivity\nand Bluetooth functionality, satellite navigation and\nreversing camera.\nThe variable traction control function, standard on\nall Evora models, was linked directly to the ECU and\nallowed the amount of wheel slip to be set by the driver\nwhilst in ‘Race/Off’. The Evora GT430 had 10mm\nwider Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres with 245/35 R19\nat the front and 295/30 R20 at the rear, on one-inch\nwider 10.5J rear wheels – these were optional fit for the\nEvora GT430 Sport. Any new Lotus could now be\npersonalised through the increasingly popular Lotus\nExclusive programme which was developed by the Lotus\nDesign team to inspire customers. The programme\ncombined traditional British craftsmanship with the best\nof modern design, and allowed owners to tailor vehicles\nto their personal taste. Since its introduction in 2016,\nroughly a third of all new Lotus cars were now\nundergoing some form of customisation.\nBoth models were powered by the same 3.5-litre, V6 supercharged and charge\ncooled engine, producing 430bhp and 440Nm of torque (Automatic version: 450Nm).\nHowever, without the aerodynamic elements, at 1248kg (dry) the Evora GT430 Sport\nweighed 10kg less, than the regular 430, bringing the power-to-weight ratio to 345bhp/\ntonne and the top speed to 196mph (315kph) making it the fastest Lotus production\ncar to date.\nThe Evora GT430 was differentiated from the later GT430 Sport through the\ninclusion of the motorsport derived aerodynamics provided by a carbon-fibre splitter,\na large, profiled carbon wing and louvers on top of each front wheel arch which,\ntogether with wider wheels and tyres reduced pressure\nwithin the front wheel arches.\nFrom January 2018, automatic transmission was\nto also be available for both the Evora GT430 body\nconfigurations. With 10Nm more torque (450Nm),\nthe Automatic version is even quicker, with\na 0-60mph time of 3.6 seconds. The six-speed automatic\ntransmission utilised an optimised gearbox ECU for\nultra-fast changes, whilst gear selection was made via\nlightweight aluminium paddles mounted to the steering\nwheel. Boasting a high specification, the new Evora\nGT430 range included, as standard, Öhlins TTX\ntwo-way adjustable dampers, J-grooved and ventilated\nbrake discs – paired with AP Racing four-piston calipers\nall round, a Torsen-type limited slip differential (LSD)\nand an adjustable traction control system.\nThe new Evora GT430 Sport made full use of\ncarbon-fibre to help hit its low kerb weight. This meant\nthat standard components included full carbon front and\nrear bumpers, front access panel, roof panel, rear quarter\npanels as well as a one-piece louvered tailgate with\nintegrated spoiler.\nThe whole of the Evora GT430 range also benefitted\nfrom advanced aerodynamics, including two enlarged\ncarbon fibre front ducts, with integrated air blades, to\nefficiently move air though to the front wheel cavities\nand reduce turbulence created by the wheels. The curved\nrear edges of the front wheel arch panels also played\na role, channelling air along the side of the car, while\nsculpted ducts behind each rear wheel vented airflow\nas quickly as possible from the wheel arches, balancing\ndownforce. As a result, the Evora GT430 Sport generated\nup to 100kg of downforce at 196mph, some fifty percent\nmore than the Evora Sport 410. The Evora GT430\ngenerated up to 250kg of downforce at 190mph.\nJean-Marc Gales commented, “This is a car that\nepitomises a purity of engineering that many car\nmanufacturers fail to match.

Focused on cutting weight and boosting\nperformance, the Lotus development team built on the\nsignificant updates introduced for the latest Elise. Dry weight\nwas reduced to just 884kg (or 860kg with all lightweight\noptions) and the adoption of advanced lightweight materials\nincluding carbon-fibre, titanium and aluminium helped to\ncut kilos from crucial areas leading to a 0-60mph in 3.9\nseconds and a power to weight of 283bhp per tonne. Buyers\nwanting to extract extra kilos from the car could select the\noptional Carbon Aero Pack, which added a composite front\nsplitter, rear wing and side boards (saving 3.7kg). Further\nweight savings could come from separately specified carbon\nitems: A hard-top (3kg), front access panel (1.1kg), roll-over\nhoop cover (0.7kg) and engine cover (3.3kg).\nChanges to the body included a redesigned\nlightweight front clam panel with wider radiator apertures\nand mesh pattern grille, and a new design of rear transom\npanel featuring two light clusters, rather than four, visually\nenhancing the design.

It is directly developed from the Elise race\ncars that are competing in series around the world, giving the ultimate Elise experience\non the road. More power, motorsport components and the introduction of aerodynamics\nunheard of in its class make driving this Elise an unrivalled experience.”\nClive Chapman, son of Lotus founder Colin Chapman and Director of Classic\nTeam Lotus (pictured below with the Cup 260), said, “Each and every one of the sports\ncars produced by Group Lotus today carries the true spirit of Lotus, laid down by my\nfather nearly 70 years ago. I am extremely proud that his\nlegacy and achievements are being acknowledged and\ncelebrated in this iconic version of the Elise.”\nTaking a blend of exotic and lightweight materials\nto produce a truly noble sports car, the Elise Cup 260 was\nconsiderably greater than the sum of its parts. Building on\nthe production Elise Cup 250 released earlier in the year,\nand drawing heavily on the development the motorsport\nElise Race 250, the Elise Cup 260’s performance was\nformed through a first-class combination of intelligent\nengineering and advanced aerodynamics, as well as a\nboost in engine performance. Not only the lightest ever\nElise Cup, it was also the heaviest at speed – with the car’s\ndesign and aero configuration generating up to 180kg of\ndownforce at 151mph. Key to this exceptionally high level\nof downforce were aero lessons learnt from the latest\nLotus models, including the Evora GT 430. The new\nlouvred front wheel-arch vents, lightweight carbon-fibre\nfront splitter and wide high mounted rear wing (developed\nfrom the Lotus 3-Eleven), were part of a no holds-barred\napproach, and the Elise Cup 260 included nearly all of\nthe lightweight Elise Cup options as standard, ranging\nfrom the sill covers, roll hoop cover, front access panel and\nengine cover which were all in carbon, to the two-piece\nbrake discs. With a race chassis developed by Lotus\nMotorsport, a polycarbonate backlight glass and hand-\ntrimmed interior with bespoke detailing, the Elise Cup\n260 was well prepared to earn its reputation as the\nultimate Elise.\nDelivering big gains from focused development, the\n2017\nTaking what was widely regarded as the\nbenchmark for intuitive handling and driver\ninvolvement and packing the company’s\npassion for motorsport engineering into one\nof the most accomplished cars it had ever\nproduced, Lotus integrated many of their\nlatest design philosophies into the race-bred,\nlimited-edition model, the Lotus Elise Cup 260.\nElise Cup 260\nType 111\n302"

Overall,\nthe fall in mass and rise in power boosted acceleration,\nwith 0-60mph dispatched in 3.8 seconds and a power to\nweight ratio of 290bhp/tonne (dry).\nEmissions figures were also impressive, at 175g/km\nCO2. Providing its trademark handling and steering feel,\nthe Elise Cup 260 featured fully independent double\nwishbone suspension with an adjustable front anti-roll bar,\nwith Nitron coaxial coil springs and, for the first time on\nan Elise, adjustable Nitron high-performance dampers.\nWith 24 settings for rebound and compression, the\ndampers allow owners to perfectly dial-in the car’s setup\nto their preference.\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise Cup 260\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2017\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n30\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged 4-cylinder Toyota VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/250bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150.5in/67.5in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.6in\nWEIGHT\n1,900lb/8,62kg\nAs standard, the Elise Cup 260 came with ultra-\nlightweight motorsport forged alloy wheels (16-inch at\nthe front and 17-inch at the rear) and were fitted with\nYokohama Advan Neova AD08R tyres (205/45 R16\nfront & 235/40 R17 rear) which were specifically\ndeveloped for high performance track and road use.\n10mm wider at the front and rear than the tyres fitted to\nthe Elise Cup 250, they provided the mechanical grip\nnecessary to exploit the power and downforce the car\ngenerated. Braking was provided by AP Racing twin-\npiston front calipers and Brembo at the rear, which were\nof course perfectly matched to the lightweight two-piece\nbrake discs.\nSumming up the new Lotus, Jean-Marc Gales said,\n“\nAs we near the 70th anniversary of the inception of\nColin Chapman’s engineering legacy, it’s only right that\nwe build the very best cars as special editions, and the\nElise Cup 260 is certainly worthy of that accolade.

        "content": "The result was a strikingly different beast of pure\nperformance, that was not for the faint of heart.\nWith 55bhp more power than the production\nExige Cup 380 model it succeeded, and with 220kg\nof downforce, it was a monster of a car. Compared\nto the Exige Sport 350, the Exige Cup 430 had\ntwenty-four percent more power and generated\nthe same downforce at 100mph as the Exige Sport\n350 did at its maximum speed of 170mph.\nThe Lotus expertise in lightweight design\nplayed its part in reducing the overall dry weight\nby 12kg to 1,059kg, with the vehicle down to\n1,056kg in its lightest configuration. This,\ncombined with the dramatic jump in raw power,\nraised the Cup 430’s power to weight from\n355bhp/tonne (Cup 380) to 407bhp/tonne.\nWith 430bhp at 7,000rpm and 440Nm (325lbft)\nof torque from 4,000rpm, 0-60mph could be\ndispatched in 3.2 seconds with a top speed of\n180mph (290kph). Helping to harness all that\npower, the Cup 430 benefitted from a\ncomprehensive range of new aero elements.\nA new ultra-lightweight front clam with\nunique carbon-fibre ducts which had wider\nradiator apertures and a new mesh pattern\ngrille to provide a more combative aspect and\nto allow for a new front splitter and air curtain\nmechanism to reduce drag. The lightweight rear\nclam panel supported the larger, straight\nmotorsport wing to increase downforce without\nimpacting upon the car’s overall drag coefficient.\nThe new design front and rear clam panels were\n6.8kg lighter than those on any other Exige.\nFocused fairly and squarely on aggressive\ntrack performance and point-to-point supremacy,\nthe new Cup 430 was capable of covering the\nHethel circuit in 1 min 24.8 seconds – the fastest\nproduction car to lap the circuit – 1.2 seconds\nfaster than the ‘road’ version of the 3-Eleven.\nJean-Marc Gales, CEO, Group Lotus plc said,\n“This is the car that we have always wanted to\nbuild, and I am sure that all Lotus enthusiasts will\nbe delighted with the end product. As well as a\nsignificant power hike, the Cup 430 has benefited\nfrom extensive development in areas essential\nto Lotus’ DNA, in order to ensure that the full\npotential of the Exige’s incredible chassis can\nbe exploited. This car has no rivals – inside or\noutside of its price bracket – and it’s no\nexaggeration when we say that nothing can\nkeep up with this Exige on the road or track.”\nAs you would expect, the intense use of ultra-\nlightweight carbon-fibre only added to the overall\nperformance, as well as reinforcing the Exige\nCup 430’s physical presence. The hand-made\ncomposite components included front splitter,\nfront access panel, roof, diffuser surround, large\naperture air-intake side pods, one-piece tailgate\nand the race derived rear wing. In addition to\nrevised steering arm geometry, to increase bump\nsteer, the car’s handling characteristics could be\naltered via the introduction of new Nitron three-\nway adjustable dampers (adjustable for rebound\nand low and high-speed compression, giving the\nability to fine tune the damping) and Eibach\nadjustable front and rear anti-roll bars, both\nas standard.\nThe substantial Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2\ntyres (215/45 ZR17 front and 285/30 ZR18 rear)\nwere fitted to ultra-lightweight forged alloy\nwheels, available in red, black or silver.\nThe faster the car, the better the brakes need\nto be, and the Exige Cup 430 used some of the\nlargest calipers and discs of any Lotus road car.\nWith forged, four-piston AP Racing brake calipers\nand new performance two-piece, J-hook brake\ndiscs (with higher thermal capacity) front and\nback, the system was designed to give improved\nbite and debris clearance and reduce distortion\nand vibration and to deliver consistent pedal\nfeel and stopping power lap after lap.\nThe Cup 430 also came with a tremendously\nstrong, yet light, T45 steel roll over bar, new\nseatbelt anchorage frame (saving 1.2 kg), a\nLithium-Ion battery and front towing eye as\nstandard, as well as a host of options including,\nelectrical cut-off and fire extinguisher\ncontrols, airbag deletion, a non-airbag steering\nwheel and an FIA compliant roll cage.\nKey to the Cup’s potency was the Exige’s\nnewly-developed powertrain. Based on the\nbenchmark engine from the recently launched\nEvora GT430, it featured an Edelbrock\nsupercharger and water to air charge cooler\nto generate more power through cooling the\nhigher pressure charged intake air. Specifically\ndeveloped for the Exige, the engine’s calibration\nallowed for a redline of 7,000rpm, helped in part\nby a new intake system and larger throttle body.\nTo handle the extra power, a new oil cooler\nconfiguration and uprated clutch were required.\nAvailable as standard with a close-ratio,\nsix-speed manual transmission, the Exige range\nfeatured Lotus’ acclaimed open-gate manual\ngearbox design. Precisely aligned for fast and\nseamless shifts, it had certainly established itself\nas a favourite of Lotus customers. To transfer the\nincreased power and torque from the engine to\nthe gearbox, a new 240mm diameter clutch was\nfitted (up 12mm compared to the Exige Cup 380)\nwhich increases the clutch surface area by 11%\n(from 36% to 45%). Anew front splitter with\ntrailing lip helped separate and speed airflow\nunder the car and the inclusion of new air curtain\nelements into the front clam panel efficiently\nmoved air though to the front wheel cavities to\nhelp reduce turbulence and drag generated by\nthe front wheels. The front louvers reduced the\n2018\nNew to the Exige range, the Cup 430 model\nsaw the introduction of a truly savage, high-\nperformance engine installation, mated to a\nnew supercharger and chargecooler, designed\nspecifically for the unique demands of this\nvehicle. A development of the powertrain\nrecently used on the Lotus Evora GT430, was\nperfectly paired with a newly-designed body,\nwhich delivered enhanced aerodynamic\nperformance to reveal the model’s true potential.\nExige Cup 430\nType 111\n304"

        "content": "Announced in January of 2018 and available in both 2 seat and 2+2 configurations,\nas well as in both manual and automatic transmission options, the Evora GT410 Sport\ndrew from the phenomenal Evora GT430 to provide advanced aerodynamics to an\nalready celebrated sports car.\nCombining the latest design philosophy with a car already acclaimed by both\ncritics and customers, the new GT 410 Sport packed raw performance with Lotus’\nlatest aerodynamic developments, to provide a first-class replacement for the Evora\nSport 410 model.\nEmploying key elements of the GT430’s sculptured body style, including specifically\ndesigned new composite front and rear body panels, but without some of the high\ndownforce elements, the new Evora GT410 Sport enjoyed a far subtler and sleeker\nsilhouette. However, as with all Lotus sports cars, aerodynamic downforce is a\nrequirement and this new GT-class coupé generated up to 96kg of downforce (50%\nmore than the Evora Sport 410) making it the new benchmark when compared\nto similarly priced rivals.\nThe Evora GT410 Sport was powered by a specially calibrated and tuned\nhigher-output version of Lotus’ supercharged, 3.5-litre 6-cylinder engine with integrated\nwater-to-air charge cooler, producing 410bhp at 7000rpm and 420Nm of torque from\n3500rpm. It powered the GT410 Sport from 0-60mph in just 3.9 seconds for the\nautomatic edition, and 4.0 seconds for the manual.\nThe development of the new Evora GT410 Sport afforded Lotus the opportunity\nto optimise mass, resulting in an unladen weight of 1,297kg and a lightest possible dry\nweight of 1,256kg (including all the optional titanium exhaust, saving 10kg, and the\nLotus-tuned Öhlins TTX aluminium two-way adjustable dampers, saving 13kg) –\na total saving of 98kg when compared to the Evora 400 benchmark, and up to 28kg\nless than the already featherweight Evora Sport 410.\nLotus’ newly defined GT-class sports car certainly\ncaptured the essence of the company’s headline model.\nThe application of top-down evolution introduced the\nnew front and rear aesthetic, first seen on the GT430. As\na result, the car’s design combined considerable physical\npresence with natural aerodynamic ability.\nThe revised front panel featured two enlarged\ncarbon-fibre ducts, with integrated air blades, to efficiently\nmove air around the front wheels reducing turbulence and\ndecreasing drag. Additional downforce was created by\nthe combination of the deep front splitter and new\nmotorsport-derived rear diffuser, mounted beneath the\nnew style metal mesh grille which gives a cleaner finish.\nSculptured carbon-fibre ducts behind each rear wheel\nvented high pressure air as quickly as possible from the\nrear wheel arches, balancing downforce.\nCumulatively this all worked to boost downforce to\n96kg at 190mph, a sizable jump of fifty percent over the\noutgoing Evora Sport 410, and a massive three-times that\nof the Evora 400 with an improved drag coefficient. This\nelevated the Evora GT410 Sport to the top ranks of\nLotus’ most aerodynamically efficient road cars.\nAs with all the high-performance Evora models,\ncarbon-fibre played a considerable role in the car’s\nconstruction. Standard carbon composite components\nincluded the front access panel, roof panel and a one-\npiece louvered tailgate with integrated spoiler, as well as\nthe elements within the front air blade system and rear\nwheel exit ports. This focus on the car’s critical mass\ndelivered a headline power-to-weight ratio of\n326bhp/tonne and the top speed to 190mph (305kph).\nDespite the car’s low mass, a range of lightweight\noptions could be specified for the Evora GT410 Sport.\nThis includes a titanium exhaust, cutting 10kg from\nbeyond the car’s rear axle.\n2018\nRelentless in its development of world-class\nsports cars, Lotus unveiled the new Evora\nGT410 Sport to complete the revised line-up\nof Hethel’s fastest model. Launched in Lotus’\n70th year and ahead of its anniversary\ncelebrations, the Evora GT410 Sport took\none of Lotus’ success stories, and refined it\nthrough the application of enlightened design.\nEvora GT410 Sport\nType 122\nMODEL\nType 122\nNAME/FORMULA\nEvora GT410 Sport\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2018-21\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nnot available\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota 2VR-FZE V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/410bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173in/72.5in/47in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,769lb/1,256kg\n306"

Capable of 0-60mph in\njust 3.3 seconds, the coupé could record fierce in-gear\nacceleration all the way to a top speed of 174mph.\nThe advanced aerodynamics were carefully balanced,\ngenerating 70kg of downforce at the rear and 45kg up front\nfor a total of 115kg at 174mph. The redesigned lightweight\nfront clam panel incorporated wider grilles, a front splitter\nand carbon-fibre air curtains to minimize drag, which\nallowed the Sport 410 to match the top speed of the\naforementioned more powerful Exige Cup 430. As with\nevery Exige however, corner speed was more important\nand even more impressive. Conveying an extraordinary\nlevel of tactility and precision, in both coupé or roadster\nforms, the Exige Sport 410 demonstrated that race car\nresponses could be enjoyed far away from the race track.\nBorn for the track but bred for the road, and despite\nthe greater consideration for road use, the Exige Sport 410\nshared many of the uprated components with its cousin,\nthe Exige Cup 430. The oil cooler, larger clutch, AP Racing\nJ-hook brake discs and 3-way adjustable Nitron dampers\nwere all re-tuned for road use and optimized to suit the car’s\nunique aerodynamic set-up. Front and rear anti-roll bars\nwere Eibach adjustable and the Nitron dampers allowed\nfor different high and low speed compression settings. The\ntenacious Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres (215/45 ZR17\nfront and 285/30 ZR18 rear), worked in harmony with the\nmid-mounted engine and ultra-lightweight forged alloy\nwheels to generate immense traction. Stopping power was\nequally impressive. With a higher thermal capacity and\nimproved bite, the new discs offered improved debris\nclearance and reduced vibration for more consistent\npedal feel and greater, fade-free stopping power.\nCentre of attention inside the driver-focused cabin\nstood the acclaimed aluminium open-gate manual gear\nshifter, giving quick, precise and tactile changes. The fine\ndetailing continued with an Alcantara steering wheel and\nLotus own carbon-fibre sports seats trimmed with either\na combination of Alcantara and leather or optional full\nleather, both featuring contrast stitching. The optional\nInterior Colour Pack (in a choice of four colours) provided\ncontrasting surrounds to the transmission console, heating\ncontrol surround and carbon seat eyelets.\nWeight saving options include a titanium exhaust,\nremoving 10kg from beyond the rear axle, plus a number\nof high-gloss, visible weave carbon-fibre parts including sill\nExige Sport 410\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige Sport 410\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2018-20\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nnot available\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE / POWER\n3456cc/410bhp\nLENGTH / WIDTH / HEIGHT\n159in/71in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2,447lbs/1,110kg\ncovers, barge boards, an instrument binnacle and roof.

        "content": "\nUndeniably an Evora, and with a unique Anglo-Sino launch livery created by Russell\nCarr, Design Director of Lotus Cars, the Evora GT4 Concept certainly bought the\ninherent talents of Lotus to bear in both the car’s aesthetic and performance credentials.\nProving its racing credentials, the last generation of Evora GT4 won prestigious\nchampionships and races at the most famous tracks around the world, including British\nGT\n, Dubai 24hrs, Barcelona 24hrs, European GT4, Sepang 12hrs the Pirelli World\nChampionship and the then recently crowned vice-champion in the Swedish GT\nSeries with Cyan Racing in 2018.\nA testament to the inherent ability of the Evora, the evolution of the new GT4\ncapitalised on the car’s already advanced road platform which was heavily influenced by\nLotus motorsport-inspired engineering. The slick shod centre lock wheels, rear wing,\naggressive stance and race ready cockpit gave an indication of the car’s true potential.\nAppointed factory drivers, Mr. Cui Yue and Mr. Gaoxiang Fan brought a Chinese\nracing pedigree to Lotus motorsport. Both were graduates of the Geely University and\nhad gone through their motorsport apprenticeships with the company’s sponsorship.\n25-year old Gaoxiang, had enjoyed success in the China Rally Championship and was\nthe 2017 Touring Car Champion of China. Cui, 29, had clocked up wins including the\n2019\nAt the Shanghai Auto Show 2019 Lotus Cars\nannounced that they would be making a return\nto the international racing arena with the launch\nof the Evora GT4 Concept. With a factory\nbacked team aiming to take part in a full 2020\nseason, successful Chinese racing drivers\nCui Yue and Gaoxiang Fan were appointed\nas its drivers.\nEvora GT4 Concept\nType 124\nTest and development driver Gavan Kershaw\nexplained “Every Lotus is famed for its performance in\nride and handling on challenging roads, surfaces and\nthrough tight corners. This performance is borne from\nyears of motorsport experience and testing at our HQ\ntest track in Hethel, UK. All of which delivers confidence,\nresponse and feel to the driver.”\nThe Lotus reputation as a leader in intelligent\nengineering was preserved through the car’s use of a\nlightweight carbon-composite body – optimised to ensure\nevery gram serves a purpose. Despite the addition of\nenhanced structural and motorsport safety systems,\nthe GT4 weighed in at 1200kg, while reaching a speed\nof 170mph.\nThe use of specifically designed hybrid body panels,\nincorporating carbon weave sections allowed for the\nintroduction of advanced aerodynamics to boost\ndownforce and high-speed stability. It employed the\nsame front clam layout as the Evora GT430 road car,\nbut with a different configuration to allow for the cooling\nrequirements of a race car. This included removable\ncanards and in-mouth brake ducts, as well as louvers\npositioned on top of each front wheel arch to reduce\npressure above the wheel. The car’s rear also uses the\nsame set up as the road car, with sculpted ducts behind\neach wheel to vent airflow as quickly as\npossible from the wheel arches, but\nadded a composite, four-\nvein diffuser and an\nadjustable,\ncarbon-fibre,\nflat-plan\nmotorsport\nwing.\nChina Touring Car Championship in 2014, China\nFormula Grand Prix, China GT and competed in the\nPorsche Carrera Cup Asia in 2018.\nThe factory drivers were set to demonstrate the car’s\npotential through the newly established Lotus’ driver\ntraining school in China, with events to be held for the\nteam and members of the public as high-octane driving\ndays, driver training sessions and hot lap experiences,\nstarting later that year.\nCommenting on the launch of new Lotus Evora GT4\nin Shanghai, Phil Popham, CEO, Lotus Cars said: “Lotus\nas a brand was born from the thrill of competition, and\nthe Evora GT4 Concept will continue that legacy while\nopening up a new chapter in our racing experience. All\nof our cars retain motorsport within their DNA, and\nalmost every road car in the company’s history has raced\nsuccessfully at some point. It’s the philosophy that Colin\nChapman founded Lotus on, and that we proudly\ncontinue to this day.”"

        "content": "Employing selected lightweight carbon-fibre components\nas standard, the new Evora GT enjoyed a revised and\nsomewhat sleeker silhouette than earlier models in the\nrange. However, as with all Lotus sports cars,\naerodynamic downforce is also a requirement and this\nnew GT-class coupé generated up to 64kg of downforce\n(double that of the Evora 400) making it the new\nbenchmark when compared to similarly priced rivals.\nThe Evora GT was powered by a specially\ncalibrated and tuned higher-output version of Lotus’\nsupercharged, 3.5-litre 6-cylinder engine with integrated\nwater-to-air charge cooler, producing 416bhp at\n7000rpm and 317lb-ft of torque from 3500rpm to give\na 0-60mph time of just 3.8 seconds. The automatic\noption had 332lb-ft and returned a similar acceleration\ntime. With all the additional lightweight options that\nwere available fitted, overall mass was further reduced\nto 3,104lbs, giving a total weight saving of just over\n70lbs when compared to the Evora 400.\nThe additional downforce was created by the\nefficient management of airflow under and over the car.\nA front lip, mounted beneath the lightweight composite\ngrille mesh grille, reduced undercar airflow, front wheel\narch air louvres and sculptured carbon-fibre ducts\nbehind each rear wheel, vented high pressure air from\nthe wheel arches and a motorsport-derived rear diffuser\nall contributed to increasing downforce front and rear.\nCurved lower A-panels smoothed airflow along the\nsides of the car, reducing drag. Cumulatively this\nelevated the Evora GT to the top ranks of Lotus’ most\naerodynamically efficient road cars.\nStandard carbon composite components included\nthe rear bumper, curved A-panels, rear wheel ducts and\nsill covers. The optional Carbon Pack included the front\naccess panel, roof panel, a one-piece louvered tailgate\nwith integrated spoiler and diffuser surround all in\ncarbon-fibre contributing to the mass reduction by\n49lbs. Reducing un-sprung mass, ultra-lightweight, fully\nmachined, forged aluminium wheels (19-inch, 8J front\nand 20-inch, 10.5J rear 10 spoke alloy wheels) were\navailable in either High Power silver or gloss black as\nstandard. The option of upgrading to one inch wider\n(10.5J) rear wheels was available in diamond cut satin\nblack or red. Stopping power came courtesy of AP\nRacing four-piston calipers front and rear with lightweight 2-piece, cross-drilled and\nventilated brake discs (front 370x32mm, rear 350x32mm).\nEvery new Lotus Evora GT could be personalised through the increasingly\npopular Lotus Exclusive programme. Developed by the Lotus Design team to inspire\ncustomers, it combined traditional British craftsmanship with the best of modern\ndesign, and allowed owners to tailor vehicles to their personal taste. Since its\nintroduction, roughly a third of all new Lotus cars were now undergoing some\nform of customisation.\n315"

A re-designed, lighter, front\nclam panel with wider apertures for improved cooling,\nsaved 8.7kg. The rear of the car now had two light\nclusters, rather than four, combining reversing and fog\nlights and adding visual width, to save 0.3kg. The exposed,\naluminium gearshift mechanism saved 1kg and brought\nquicker, more precise, more tactile gear changes.\nOffering 217bhp and 250 Nm of torque, the 1.8-litre\nsupercharged, chargecooled four-cylinder from Toyota\nwas tuned to deliver stunning real-world performance and\nclass-leading efficiency. 0-60mph was now despatched in\n4.2 seconds, thanks to a power-to-weight ratio of up to\n257bhp/per ton. CO2 emissions were extremely low for\nthe dramatic performance on offer at just 173g/km.\nStopping power was provided by AP Racing twin-\npiston calipers up front and Brembo single-piston calipers\nat the rear. Every vehicle in the Elise range benefits from\ndouble wishbone suspension at all four corners and a\nsophisticated Lotus Dynamic Performance Management\n(Lotus DPM) system with user selectable driving modes\n(Drive, Sport and Off), and the Sport 220 was no\nexception. Hethel’s acoustic engineers also transformed\nthe aural appeal of the Elise, with a new exhaust system\nfitted as standard. Delivering an exciting soundtrack at\nall speeds, it made the Elise Sport 220 probably the\nbest-sounding Elise yet.\nThe cabin remained a totally driver-focused,\nminimalist delight, with the controls – seats, pedals and\ntiny steering wheel all perfectly aligned and lifted by the\naddition of the exposed aluminium gear shift mechanism,\ncomplete with tall ball-topped gearlever just a hand’s span\naway from the wheel. Further weight savings could be\nachieved with a wide range of optional, stunning quality\ncarbon-fibre panels, a lithium-ion battery, two-piece AP\nRacing brakes, carbon-fibre race seats, a titanium exhaust\nand carbon-fibre sill covers which also improved ingress\nand egress. A new in-car entertainment system could also\nbe ordered, including i-Pod connectivity and Bluetooth\nfunctionality.\nModifications at both the front and back allowed for\nthe careful balancing of aerodynamic downforce across\nthe whole car and extended rubber elements mounted on\nthe flat underside and ahead of the front wheel, together\nwith an additional diffuser vane at the rear, helped modify\nairflow under the car reducing drag and increasing\nhigh-speed stability.\nAs it approached a 25th year in production, the\ncynics could argue that the Elise hadn’t changed and\ndeveloped much over the years, after all, it was still being\nbuilt around an extruded and bonded alumium chassis,\nas it alwas has been. But in reality, the Elise highlighted\njust how overweight, over-the-top and cumbersome its\nso-called rivals had become. The Elise was without doubt\nthe perfect antidote to modern cars without feeling in\nthe slightest bit outdated.\n2019\nThe revised 2019 Elise Sport 220 continued to\nbuild on the many celebrated Elise virtues. Once\nagain the engineers at Lotus worked on blending\nagility, power, balance and communication into\none compact expression of pure driving joy, as\nbeautifully simple, pleasingly compact and\nbristling with energy and feedback as it was\nwhen it was first released 23 years before.\nElise Sport 220\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise Sport 220\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2019-21\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nnot available\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged 4-cylinder Toyota VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/217bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150.5in/67.7in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.6in\nWEIGHT\n1,949lb/884kg"

Following the\nEvora’s 2015 facelift there had been the 400, the 400\nHethel Edition, the Sport 410, the GT430 and the\nGT430 Sport, but by the start of 2020 your only option in\nEurope at least, was the 2019 model year GT410 Sport.\nIn the four years to the end of 2019 the Evora range had\nseen just under 2,000 cars emerge from the Hethel factory.\nNew for 2020 though was the Evora GT410. Rather\nthan a whole new Evora, the new model was for all\nintense and purposes a new trim level, but one that made\nperfect sense. Lotus Cars were keen to point out that it\nwas designed to be a more usable daily driver than the\nGT410 Sport.\n“Over the past three to four years we’ve been\nextremely focused on the lightest possible cars, the highest\npower, extracting real lap times out of them all,” said\nGavan Kershaw at Lotus.\n“We’d moved away from plushness and then, when\nPhil Popham joined as our new boss he had an Evora as\nhis personal car and said ‘it’s amazing, but I’m doing quite\na big commute…’ So I said I could work with the car. We\ntook a spec similar to the Evora we export to America. He\nstarted to drive that more and we morphed and morphed\nthe setup until we ended up with a big enough difference\nto offer ‘sport’ and ‘comfort’ versions.”\nDesigned to be more of a true ‘every day’ car, it\ncame with Sparco sport seats and air-con to create a more\ncomfortable environment for occupants, while a reversing\ncamera improves safety during low-speed manoeuvres.\nA premium infotainment system with sat-nav and Apple\nCarPlay was now standard and included DAB digital\nradio for the first time. Increased cabin sound insulation\nfor reduced road noise and improved refinement\nfurther improved the listening experience.\nAvailable in both with and without the rear seat\noption, inside the GT410’s door trims now featured\nintegrated arm rests and storage bins for greater comfort\nand practicality. Exterior paint colour choices were revised\nto include new options, including some historic shades\nfrom Lotus’ past.\nThe car had a revised damper rate compared with\nthe GT410 Sport. While it still delivered an outstanding\nperformance-oriented experience, this adaptation created\na more compliant ride for improved real-world comfort.\nThe use of Michelin Pilot Sport 4S all-weather tyres\nmeant better all-year usability, while a new rear tailgate\nfeatured a large glass section for much improved\nrearward visibility.\nStandard Evora features remained, including a\nbody-coloured roof, side sills, tailgate, front access panel\nand mirror backs, red AP Racing brake calipers and\nsilver or gloss black V-spoke cast alloy wheels, 19-inch\nat the front and 20-inch at the rear. Interior equipment\ncontinued to include cruise control, heated seats, and\nrear parking sensors.\nAmazingly, with a UK price of only £82,900, the\nGT410 was £3,000 less than the GT410 Sport but kept\nthe same 410bhp 3.5-litre supercharged V6 and 186mph\ntop speed. Impressively, despite getting air-con, Sparco\nsports seats, a reversing camera and a ‘premium\ninfotainment system’ as standard; it was also the same\nweight as the Sport at 1,361kg. Like the Sport, the GT410\nwas available with either a six-speed manual or six-speed\nautomatic gearbox.

We have\ncreated something beautiful, something new, dramatic and unique.” The\nEvija was set to be the most powerful and dynamically accomplished road\ncar in the history of Lotus, and set a new standard for Lotus driving\nperformance. It was the first all-electric British hypercar and the first Lotus\nwith an electrified powertrain, as well as the first new model since Geely\ntook control of Lotus in 2017.\nAt first known only by its Lotus Type number – Type 130 – the car was\nchristened the Lotus Evija (pronounced ‘E-vi-ya’). As a name it is derived\nfrom variations of Eve, and means ‘the first in existence’ or ‘the living one’.\nIt is highly appropriate; Lotus has an unquestionable reputation for its\npioneering approach in both automotive and motorsport. The Evija was the\nfirst Lotus road car to feature a one-piece carbon-fibre monocoque chassis.\n2020\nAt an exclusive event at the Royal Horticultural\nHalls in London in July of 2019, Lotus shocked\nthe assemble press and unveiled the Evija, the\nworld’s first all electric, British-built hypercar. Phil\nPopham, Lotus Cars (UK) CEO described it as a\nbold statement of intent from the British company,\nillustrative of its ambition under the stewardship\nof Geely. He added: “Evija will re-establish Lotus\nas a leader in terms of engineering and design.”\nEvija\nType 130\nThe cabin, from the fully adjustable race-style\nseats to the multi-function steering wheel, was\nthe very pinnacle of motorsport-inspired road\ncar design and technology.\nAt the heart of the Evija was an ultra-\nadvanced all-electric powertrain, which had\nbeen developed with technical partner Williams\nAdvanced Engineering, famed for success in\nmotorsport, from Formula One to electrifying\nthe first four seasons of Formula E. The battery\npack was mid-mounted immediately behind the\ntwo seats and supplied energy directly to four\npowerful e-motors. This highly efficient system\nwas the lightest, most energy dense, electric\npower package ever fitted to a road car. With\na target weight of just 1,680kg, the Evija was\nset to be the lightest pure electric hypercar\never to go into series production.\nEngineered for precise and sustained\nperformance, the Evija had five driving modes –\nRange, City, Tour, Sport and Track and could rush\nfrom 0-62mph (0-100km/h) in under three seconds\nand accelerate to a top speed of more than\n200mph (0-320km/h).\nThe most striking element of the Lotus Evija\nwas its exterior. From every angle the full carbon-\nfibre bodywork appeared shrink-wrapped over\nthe mechanical components. Unquestionably the\nmost dramatic element of the exterior – was the\nVenturi tunnel that pierced each rear quarter.\nInspired by Le Mans racecars, they optimised\nairflow by directing it through the bodyshell. This\ndesign concept – known as ‘porosity’ – aided the\ndelivery of high-energy airflow to the rear of the\ncar. This in turn counteracted the low pressure\nbehind the car to reduce drag. Furthermore,\nthe Venturi effect inside the tunnels pulled air\nthrough the rear wheel arch louvres, maintaining\nair quality in the diffuser.\nWhen viewed from the rear of the car, each\nMilestone Car\ntunnel was edged with a red LED to create a\nstriking ribbon-style light signature. The result\nwas a stunning visual effect that was akin to the\nafterburners on a fighter jet, especially when\nseen at night. As an extra detail, an LED hidden\nwithin each tunnel illuminated its interior.\nThe directional indicators were incorporated\ninto the corners of the ribbon, while the reversing\nlight was provided by the illuminated ‘T’ of\nthe ‘LOTUS’ wordmark above the integrated\ncharging flap. Another key feature of the Evija’s\nsophisticated aerodynamic system was the\nbi-plane front splitter. It was another illustration\nof form and function working perfectly in\ntandem. Designed in three sections, the larger\ncentral area provided air to cool the battery pack\n– mid-mounted behind the two seats – while the\nair channelled through the two smaller outer\nsections cools the front e-axle.\nWhen asked how the Evija’s sophisticated\naerodynamics compared to more regular sports\ncars, Richard Hill, the highly experienced senior\nengineer who has guided this critical element of\nthe car’s design commented: “It’s like comparing\na fighter jet to a child’s kite.’’\nHe further , “It’s about keeping the airflow\nlow and flat at the front and guiding it through\nthe body to emerge high at the rear. Put simply, it\ntransforms the whole car into an inverted wing to\nproduce that all-important dynamic downforce.\nMost cars have to punch a hole in the air, to get\nthrough using brute force, but the Evija is unique\nbecause of its porosity. The car literally ‘breathes’\nthe air. The front acts like a mouth; it ingests the\nair, sucks every kilogram of value from it – in this\ncase, the downforce – then exhales it through that\ndramatic rear end.”\nAs the first all-electric hypercar from a British\ncar maker, the launch of the Evija saw Lotus\ndeliver an opportunity for new and exciting\nexpansion of the sector. Increasing consumer\nawareness and demand for the astonishing\nperformance available through EV powertrains\nmeant new growth and new skills, and Lotus\nintended to be key player in that revolution."

Working with the Evora\nGT4 chassis platform from the successful 2017 and 2018 seasons, the long-term intention\nfor the project was always to underpin the car with the yet to be announced and still top\nsecret Emira suspension, power train and gearbox. The basic concept of the 2020 Evora\nGT Racecar was as a development project for the also yet to be announced, Emira GT4\nproject which would be given the same 131 Type number as the Emira ahead of the\nsoon to be announced Type 132 Lifestyle Vehicle.\nCommenting on the prospect of seeing a Type 129 on the track, the CEO of Lotus\nCars at the time, Phil Popham said: “Lotus as a brand was born from the thrill of\ncompetition,\nand this new Evora\nracecar will continue that legacy\nwhile opening a new chapter in our racing experience. All\nof our road cars retain motorsport within their DNA, and\nalmost every road car in the company’s history has raced\nsuccessfully at some point. It’s the philosophy that Colin\nChapman founded Lotus on, and that we proudly\ncontinue to this day.”\nWith the intention of running a race-programme in\n2021, work on the Type 129 moved ahead and the first\ntwo chassis were completed by October 2020 but, the best\nlaid plans of everyone took a turn and, as the uncertainty\nof the Covid-19 Pandemic hit the world it was decided\nnot to push ahead with a race program in 2021. Instead\nthe decision was made to run a low key, limited test\nprogram. The knowledge gained was fed back in to the\nEmira GT4 racecar project led by Richard Selwin that\nby mid-2020 was nearing an official press announcement.\nFollowing the experience gained with the Evora GT4\nConcept racecar, the Type 129 would feature the Lotus\nMotorsport developed, 400bhp variant of the now\nfamiliar Toyota V6 2GR-FE power-unit, fed by a Harrop\nTVs 1900 Supercharger. This was coupled to an Xtrac\n6-speed paddleshift gearbox and fitted with a Motec ECU\nand full data logger with video integration that could be\nread in the cockpit (see left). Despite the addition of\nenhanced structural and motorsport safety systems, the\nType 129 weighed in at just 1230kg and could reach\na top speed on the track of more than 170mph.\nA testament to the inherent ability of the Evora, the\nType 129 capitalised on the roadcar’s already advanced\n2020\nIn the middle part of 2019, Director of Vehicle\nAttributes for Lotus Motorsport Gavan Kershaw and\nVehicle Line Director at Lotus Cars Neil Thomas\ndeveloped a plan to get Lotus back into racing on\na long-term basis. The idea of a factory backed GT4\nteam evolved out of the 2019 Evora GT4 Concept\nracecar that had been at the Shanghai Motorshow\nand at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2019.\nEvora GT Racecar\nType 129\nMODEL\nType 129\nNAME/FORMULA\nEvora GT Racecar\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2020\nEXAMPLES BUILT\n2\nENGINE TYPE\nToyota V6 2GR-FE\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/400bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n173.7in/78.5in/50.8in\nWHEELBASE\n101.2in/2570mm\nWEIGHT\n2712lb/1,230kg\nroad platform which\nhad been heavily influenced by\nLotus motorsport-inspired engineering.

The ABS braking system was supplied by Bosch.\nGavan Kershaw who also performed the duties of\nchief test and development driver explained “Every\nLotus is famed for its performance in ride and handling\non challenging roads, surfaces and through tight corners.\nThis performance is borne from years of motorsport\nexperience and testing at our test track in Hethel,\nsomething which delivers confidence, response and\nfeel to the customer.”\nThe reputation Lotus holds as a leader in intelligent\nengineering was preserved through the car’s use of\na lightweight carbon-composite body – optimised to\nensure every gram serves a purpose. The use of\nspecifically designed hybrid body panels, incorporating\ncarbon weave sections allowed for the introduction of\nadvanced aerodynamics to boost downforce and high-\nspeed stability. Employing essentially the same front\nclam layout as the Evora GT430 road car, the revised\nconfiguration allowed for the cooling requirements of a\nrace car. This included removable canards and in-mouth\nbrake ducts, as well as louvers positioned on top of each\nfront wheel arch to reduce pressure above the wheel.\nThe car’s rear also used the same set up as the road\ncar, with sculpted ducts behind each wheel to vent airflow\nas quickly as possible from the wheel arches, but added\na composite, four-vein diffuser and an adjustable,\ncarbon-fibre, Lotus motorsport wing."

Finished in a\nchoice of vibrant new retro-inspired colours, the Lotus\nExige Sport 410 ‘20th Anniversary’ edition boasted\nhigher levels of standard equipment as well as an\nenhanced interior package.\nAll six colour versions (Chrome Orange, Laser Blue,\nCalypso Red, Saffron Yellow, Motorsport Black and\nArctic Silver) came with upgraded exterior features\ncommemorating the Series 1 Exige that had first been\nunveiled at Brands Hatch back in 2000. These styling cues\nincluded body-coloured roof, side air intake pods and rear\nwing, plus the black ‘shark fin’ stone chip protector ahead\nof the rear wheel. The nostalgia was carried over to the\ninterior, where there was a choice of different coloured\ntrim where each seat was decorated with panelled\nstitching, again echoing the original car.\nPart of the new car’s customer appeal was the unique\n‘20th Anniversary’ black silhouette logo featuring a\nstriking profile image of the Series 1 Exige that was\nplaced on the front wings above the side repeaters and on\nthe rear bumper. The logo was also embroidered on the\nseat backs and embossed on the car’s dashboard ‘build\nplaque’. A distinctive ‘20’ logo on the rear wing end plates\nadded the finishing touch to the design.\nThe car’s list of standard equipment included Nitron\ndampers which had variable bump and re-bound settings\nthat enabled the driver to personalise the suspension to\nsuit driving style and environment. The front splitter, front\naccess panel and rear tailgate were all made from carbon-\nfibre. Also include as standard were DAB digital radio\nwith Bluetooth, cruise control, ultra-lightweight forged\nalloy wheels and an Alcantara steering wheel.\nIn bringing it’s 410bhp chargecooled power to those\nwanting to enjoy exceptional road dynamics, the Exige\nSport 410 boasted 369bhp per ton from an unladen\nweight of just 1110 kg. Capable of 0-60mph in just 3.3\nseconds, its coupé form could record fierce in-gear\nacceleration all the way to a top speed of 174mph.\nThe advanced aerodynamics were carefully balanced,\ngenerating 70kg of downforce at the rear and 45kg up\nfront for a total of 115kg at 174mph. The lightweight\nfront clam panel incorporated wider grilles, a front splitter\nand carbon-fibre air curtains to minimize drag, allowing\nthe Sport 410 to match the top speed of the more\npowerful Exige Cup 430 that had first been seen in 2017.\nWeight saving options included a titanium exhaust,\nremoving 10kg from beyond the rear axle, plus a number\nof high-gloss, visible weave carbon-fibre parts including\nsill covers, bargeboards, an instrument binnacle and roof.\nDespite the greater consideration for road use, the\nExige Sport 410 shared many of the uprated components\nwith the Exige Cup 430. The oil cooler, larger clutch, AP\nRacing J-hook brake discs and 3-way adjustable Nitron\ndampers were re-tuned for road use and optimized to suit\nthe car’s unique aerodynamic set-up. Front and rear anti-\nroll bars were Eibach adjustable and the Nitron dampers\nallowed for different high and low speed compression\nsettings. The Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres (215/45\nZR17 front and 285/30 ZR18 rear), worked in harmony\nwith the mid-mounted engine and ultra-lightweight\nforged alloy wheels to generate immense traction.\nStopping power was equally impressive thanks to AP\nRacing brakes with forged, four-piston calipers and two-\npiece J-hook brake discs. With a higher thermal capacity\nand improved bite, these discs offered improved debris\nclearance and reduced vibration for more consistent pedal\nfeel and greater, stopping power.\nExige Sport 410 20th Anniversary\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige Sport 410 (20th Anniversary)\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2020\nEXAMPLES BUILT\nnot avaiable\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota 2GR-FZE V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/410bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n160.8in/71in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2447lbs/1110kg"

The famous black and gold references the\nlivery of the Lotus Type 72D which Emerson Fittipaldi\nraced to five victories over the course of the 1972\nFormula 1 season. Red, white and gold echoed the Type\n49B that Graham Hill raced in 1968, while the blue,\nred and silver was inspired by the 1980 Essex Team\nLotus Type 81 driven by Nigel Mansell, Elio de Angelis\nand Mario Andretti.\nThe fourth new Elise, finished in blue and white,\nwas in tribute to the Lotus Type 18 design from 1960.\nExactly 60 years previously, it had been the first Lotus\ncar to achieve a Formula 1 pole position and victory,\ncourtesy of the late Sir Stirling Moss, at the Monaco\nGrand Prix.\nOfficially titled the Elise Classic Heritage Editions,\nall four cars offered an enhanced exterior and interior\nspec over the Elise Sport 220 on which they were based.\nAs well as their unique colour schemes – instantly\nrecognisable by motorsport fans worldwide – each car\ncame with a numbered ‘build plaque’ on the dashboard\nreferencing the limited production run. A total of just\n100 cars were to be made, but probably not twenty-five\nof each, as one might have imagined. The final\nnumbers of each variant were to be dictated by\ncustomer demand.\nEach car had as standard a number of features\nwhich were previously only on the options list. These\nincluded DAB digital radio with four speakers, air-\nconditioning, cruise control, ultra-lightweight forged\nalloy wheels with racing livery finish, two-piece disc\nbrakes and black carpet with floor mats.\nThe Elise interior colour pack was also now\nintegrated as standard. Elements included the upper\ndoor trim and central seat insert finished to match the\nexterior, with detailing on the door, gear selector\nsurround and dashboard picking out key colours. The\nonly one that was different was the blue and white\n‘Moss’ car, which had red Alcantara seat centres.\nPricing was very simple – all four cars cost exactly\nthe same, at £46,250. While that was £6,350 more\nthan a standard Elise Sport 220, with the £11,735 value\nof ‘added features’ it certainly represented outstanding\nvalue for money.\nEven with a host of options included as standard,\nextra options were however available for each of the\nfour models, including a fibreglass hardtop roof,\nlightweight lithium-ion battery and titanium lightweight\nexhaust system.\nAs with the regular 220 Sport model, the Elise\nClassic Heritage Editions came with a 1.8-litre,\nsupercharged Toyota 2ZR-FE engine that produced\n217bhp.

First\nlaunched in 2000, the Lotus Exige in all its itterations had\nbecome the true genre-defining definition of a race car for\nthe road.\nAs standard, the 390 Final Edition featured the most\nextensive list of interior and exterior features ever. The\nbiggest upgrade, as on the other ‘Final Edition’ models, was\nthe all-new TFT digital dashboard with the choice of two\nscreens, one with a conventional set of dials and the other a\nrace car-style with digital speed read-out and an engine\nspeed bar.\nThe steering wheel was also of a new design. Clad in\nleather and Alcantara, it featured a flat base to create better\nleg clearance for taller drivers and to aid ingress and egress.\nEvery car came with a Final Edition build plaque, as well as\nnew seat trim and stitch patterns.\nA new selection of colours that was introduced for the\nExige Sport 390, harked back to some of the iconic colour\nschemes from Lotus’ past. They were split into two; Select,\nwhich included Daytona Blue, Fire Red, Metallic Orange\nand Motorsport Black; and Heritage, which included\nRacing Green, Nightfall Blue, Essex Blue and Calypso Red.\nThe Exige 390 Sport was powered by a 3.5-litre,\nsupercharged V6 with a baffled sump, mounted in a light-\nweight and rigid chassis that provided thrilling acceleration\nand instant response. Pure unassisted steering offered\nexquisite feedback and vivid communication at all speeds.\nThe car benefitted from its own, bespoke version of Lotus’\npioneering, bonded aluminium chassis, a unique rear sub-\nframe and forged aluminium double wishbone suspension\nat the rear.\nThe 2021 Exige Sport 390 replaced the outgoing Exige\nSport 350. The power increase of 47bhp came from a\nrevised calibration linked to the Edelbrock supercharger\nwith chargecooling, to produce 397bhp and 420Nm. It\ncould accelerate to 60mph in just 3.7 seconds before\nreaching a top speed of 172mph.\nThe advanced aerodynamics were carefully balanced, generating 70kg of downforce\nat the rear and 45kg up front for a total of 115kg at top speed. To put this power on to\nthe road, the Exige Sport 390 had 10-spoke, silver lightweight forged alloy wheels (7.5J x\n17-inch front and 10J x 18-inch rear) and Michelin PS4 tyres (205/45 ZR17 front and\n265/35 ZR18 rear).\nFor those who had never been huge fans of the transverse 3.5-litre V6 sourced from\nToyota (and believe it or not, there were some) credit had to be given where it’s due on the\nfinal iterations of the Exige. It really did feel more bespoke now than it ever has before. The\namazing response (with no turbo delay) from the always-there-for-you supercharger, decent\nnoise – especially once up past 4,500rpm – and extra energy as it homed in on the\n7,000rpm limit made the 400bhp Exige an absolute star.\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nExige Sport 390 (Final Edition)\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2021\nEXAMPLES BUILT\ncurrently not available\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged, Toyota 2GR-FZE V6 VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n3456cc/397bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n160.8in/71in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n93.5in\nWEIGHT\n2480lbs/1125kg"

With aerodynamically optimised components such as\nthe front splitter, rear wing, rear diffuser and side floor extension, this Final Edition\ncar produced 66kg of downforce at 100mph and 155kg of downforce at is maximum\nspeed of 154mph.\nThe car was shod with new 10-spoke Diamond Cut ultra-lightweight M Sport\nforged wheels (7Jx16-inch front and 8Jx17-inch rear) with Yokohama A052 tyres\n(195/50 R16 front and 225/45 R17 rear). The extensive list of standard equipment\nincluded Bilstein sport dampers and adjustable anti-roll bars, to help maximise the\naerodynamic downforce available and boost grip whilst maintaining the legendary\nElise handling. Also fitted as standard was a lightweight lithium-ion battery and\nThe five Final Edition cars, which all had higher power,\ngreater standard specification and – in true Lotus style –\nlighter weight, were to be built in limited numbers and\nwere the ultimate versions of the Elise and Exige. Thus\nmarking the pinnacle of technical development and\nshowcasing more than two decades of engineering\nexcellence.\nThe Elise was a truly iconic Lotus, with 2021\nserving as the 25th and final year of production. The\nElise Sport 240 Final Edition was a fitting tribute, and\nthe exclusivity and rarity will no doubt ensure high\ndemand and guarantee future classic status. It retained\nall the core values and features that have made the Elise\nsuch an iconic car – a small, light and agile two-seater\npowered by a supercharged and chargecooled 1.8-litre,\nfour-cylinder mid-mounted engine.\nAs standard, the Sport 240 featured the most\nextensive list of interior and exterior features ever. The\nbiggest upgrade was the all-new TFT digital dashboard\npolycarbonate rear window.\nAs on the Elise Sport 240 Final Edition, other\nlightweight carbon-fibre options were available on the\nCup 250 Final Edition that could help reduce the mass\nto an unladen weight of just 931kg.\nAs standard, the Cup 250 featured the most\nextensive list of interior and exterior features ever seen\non an Elise. The biggest upgrade was the all-new TFT\ndigital dashboard with the choice of two screens, one\nwith a conventional set of dials and the other a race car-\nstyle with digital speed read-out and an engine speed bar.\nThe steering wheel was also a new design and clad\nin leather and Alcantara. It featured a flat base to create\nbetter leg clearance for taller drivers and to aid ingress\nand egress. Every car came with a Final Edition build\nplaque, plus new seat trim and stitch patterns.\nA new selection of colours was introduced for the\nElise Cup 250 and in fact, all the Final Edition range,\nharking back to some of the iconic colour schemes from\nthe Elise and Lotus’ past. They were split into three;\nSelect, which included Daytona Blue, Fire Red, Metallic\nOrange and Motorsport Black; Heritage, which\nincluded Racing Green, Nightfall Blue, Essex Blue and\nCalypso Red; and Special, which included\nIsotope Green, Vivid Green, Pearl\nYellow and Burnt Orange.\nElise Sport 240 Final Edition\nType 111\nElise Cup 250 Final Edition\nType 111\nMODEL\nType 111\nNAME/FORMULA\nElise Cup 250 (Final Edition)\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2021\nEXAMPLES BUILT\ncurrently not available\nENGINE TYPE\nSupercharged 4-cylinder Toyota VVT-i\nENGINE SIZE/POWER\n1796cc/245bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n150.5in/67.7in/44in\nWHEELBASE\n90.6in\nWEIGHT\n2,052lb/931kg"

Of course, every car in the Final Edition\nrange came with a Final Edition build plaque, plus new\nseat trim and stitch patterns.\nA new selection of colours was introduced for the\nElise Sport 240, harking back to some of the iconic\ncolour schemes from the Elise and Lotus’ past. They\nwere split into two; Select, which included Daytona\nBlue, Fire Red, Metallic Orange and Motorsport Black;\nand Heritage, which included Racing Green, Nightfall\nBlue, Essex Blue and Calypso Red.\nThe Elise Sport 240 Final Edition gained an extra\n23bhp from a revised calibration and so replaced the\nSport 220. Delivering 240bhp and 244Nm of torque,\nthe engine was tuned to provide stunning real-world\nperformance and class-leading efficiency. The 0-60mph\nsprint was now completed in 4.1 seconds thanks to a\npower-to-weight ratio of 260bhp per tonne. As\never, CO2 emissions of 177g/km were extremely\nlow for the performance on offer.\nThe car came with 10-spoke Anthracite\nlightweight forged alloy wheels as standard\n(6Jx16-inch front and 8Jx17-inch rear).\nThey were 0.5kg lighter than the wheels on\nthe Elise Sport 220 and shod with Yokohama\nV105 tyres (195/50 R16 both front and\n225/45 R17 rear).\nFurther weight savings were achievable\nthrough an extensive range of optional\ncarbon-fibre panels, including sill covers\nand engine cover, plus a lightweight\npolycarbonate rear window. With all the\nlightweight options chosen, the mass of the\nElise Sport 240 could be reduced further\nfrom 922kg to 898kg.\nExige Sport 420 Final Edition\nType 111\nThe Exige range was celebrated in its final year of\nproduction with three new models – the Exige Sport\n390, Exige Sport 420 and Exige Cup 430.\nLike the Elise, new equipment for this final year of\nproduction included unique paint choices, new decals\nand two new wheel finishes. All versions of the Exige\nalso came with the TFT digital dashboard, Final\nEdition build plaque, new steering wheel, as well as\nnew seat trim and stitch patterns.\nAll models were powered by a 3.5-litre\nsupercharged V6 with a baffled sump, mounted in a\nlightweight and rigid chassis that provided thrilling\nacceleration and instant response. Pure unassisted\nsteering offered exquisite feedback and vivid\ncommunication at all speeds. The Exige benefitted\nfrom a bespoke version of Lotus’ pioneering bonded\naluminium chassis, a unique rear subframe and forged\naluminium double wishbone suspension at the rear.\nLike the Elise Final Edition range, all the Exige\nmodels were also available in a selection of new colours\nrepresenting significant cars in its history. These\nincluded Metallic White, from the unveiling of the\nV6 Exige at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2011, and\nMetallic Orange, which was used on the first press fleet\ncar in 2000 and the Exige GT3 concept from the\nGeneva Motor Show 2007.\nThe Exige Sport 420 Final Edition gained an extra\n10bhp and replaced the outgoing Sport 410. It was the\nfastest Exige available, topping out at 180mph, with\n0-60mph completed in 3.3 seconds. With its light weight\nof 1,110kg and 420bhp (giving a power to weight of\n378bhp per tonne) and 427Nm from the supercharged\nand chargecooled V6 engine, coupled with a flat torque\ncurve and maximum power available to maximum revs,\nthe Exige could certainly be regarded as the most\ncomplete driving car of its class.\nThe list of standard equipment was impressive. Front and rear Eibach anti-roll\nbars are adjustable and the three-way adjustable Nitron dampers allow for different\nhigh and low speed compression settings. The car rode on 10-spoke Anthracite\nlightweight forged alloy wheels (7.5J x 17-inch front, 10J x 18-inch rear) with Michelin\nPilot Sport Cup 2 tyres (215/45 ZR17 front and 285/30 ZR18 rear). Stopping power\ncame from AP Racing brakes with forged, four-piston calipers and two-piece J-hook\nbrake discs. With a higher thermal capacity and improved bite, these discs offer\nimproved debris clearance."

Those instantly recognisable brand\nsignatures and core values were combined with a paradigm shift in levels of practicality,\ncomfort, functionality and technology.\nMatt Windle, Managing Director, Lotus Cars commented: “The Emira is\na game-changer for Lotus. It stands as a beacon of everything we have achieved to date\nin the transformation of the business, the embodiment of our progress. It is a highly\nsignificant milestone on our path to becoming a truly global performance car brand.”\nThe Emira was developed on an all-new lightweight\nbonded aluminium chassis technology pioneered by Lotus\nover the previous 25 years and which remains an intrinsic\npart of the company’s sports car DNA. In this instance,\nthat innovative vehicle architecture was wrapped with\na bold and sculpted design using cues clearly developed\nfrom the Evija.\nWith the first customer cars scheduled for delivery in\nthe spring of 2022 the biggest surprise on the Emira was\nthat there would be a choice of two petrol engines from\ndifferent manufacturers, both globally respected for their\nperformance characteristics. The first ‘Launch’ cars would\nbe available as limited-production ‘First Edition’ models\npowered by the much-loved and Lotus-honed 3.5-litre,\nToyota-derived V6 engine, which had cut its Hethel teeth\npowering the Evora and Exige.

Transverse-mounted\nand delivering rear-wheel drive, the unit was modified\nwith a new air intake system and new exhaust to suit the\ncharacter and mid-engined format of the Emira.\nFollowing more than £100million of new investment\nin the company’s UK facilities, manufacturing of the\nEmira was set to take place at the home of Lotus in\nHethel, Norfolk. The highly skilled operations teams\nwere to be supported by new processes and technologies\nto enhance production efficiency, volume capability\nand overall quality.\nMatt Windle added: “The Lotus Emira is the most\naccomplished Lotus road car ever to roll through the\nHethel factory gates. Beautifully proportioned with a\nstunning design inspired by the Evija all-electric hypercar,\nit’s the perfect package.

A truly contemporary look\nwith sculpted surfaces and technical detailing, delivering\nexotic supercar appeal in the sports car segment. As a new\nand more premium approach for Lotus in terms of forms\nand materials, it was also a leap forward in fit and finish.\nLed by Russell Carr, Design Director at Lotus, the\ncreative team succeeded in designing something beautiful,\ntimeless, memorable, modern, and most importantly, that\nlooks like a Lotus. Carr commented: “The Emira captures\nthe visual drama of an exotic supercar, with great\nproportions, wide footprint and a cabin that sits low down\nbetween muscular haunches. Add in that it’s practical\nenough to be useable every day, of the highest quality and\naccessibly priced, and it’s undoubtedly a compelling and\nseductive alternative to the existing sports car competition.\nThe Emira is re-introducing our brand to a new global\naudience while still offering all the thrills to engage the\nmost ardent driving enthusiast.”\nThe influence of the Lotus Evija was plain to see\nthrough the fluid surfaces and crisp feature lines of\nthe Emira. The lineage was even more obvious on the\nprominent leading edge of the bonnet, shrink-wrapped\ncabin that tapered to the rear, sculpted doors and vents\ncut into the muscular rear haunches. The unique-in-class\nexit vents, integrated into the bonnet to guide airflow over\nthe car and optimise aerodynamics, were also derived\nfrom the Evija.\nVertical LED headlamps with a wing-inspired twin\nblade design also familiar from the Lotus hypercar were\nstandard across the Emira range and the bonnet features\na (slightly larger than on previous models) new iteration\nof the iconic Lotus roundel that is making its first\nappearance on a Lotus production car.\nLooking at the Emira in profile, the sculpted section\ncut into the door lead air flow towards the intake ahead of\nthe rear wheel. This served a dual purpose, providing air\nfor the engine but also cooling. The Emira name badge that was visible from the side was\ncleverly integrated into the C-pillar. The new 20-inch diameter, 10-spoke wheels were\nfitted with a Goodyear Eagle F1 Supersport tyres. In conjunction with the Lotus Drivers\nPack, Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres were also available. Both tyre options were\nspecially developed for the Emira by their manufacturer.\nAt the rear, the Lotus wordmark dominates the integrated bumper that sat below\na body coloured panel that was clearly inspired by the rear of the Evija. At each side was\nan exit vent for air from the wheel arch. Each corner had a flat C-shaped LED light\ncluster linked by a slimline high-level brake light. Below the rear bumper was a black\nsection housing twin exhaust pipes either side of the number plate and with an air\ndiffuser underneath to aid downforce.\nThe Emira was built on the then recently announced new Lotus Sports Car\nArchitecture and used the same pioneering Lotus bonded extruded aluminium chassis\ntechnology which debuted on the Elise. However, for the Emira, every dimension was\ndifferent to any previous Lotus chassis and was fabricated in an all-new facility – Lotus\nAdvanced Structures – in Norwich, just a few miles from Hethel.\nThe car had two defined chassis and suspension settings. Tour was tuned for\neveryday road use, delivering the optimum blend of Lotus dynamic performance and\nhandling with a more comfortable ride, whilst the Sports set-up that was available with\nthe optional Lotus Drivers Pack, provided a slightly stiffer suspension set-up for enhanced\ndynamic capability and feel.\nGavan Kershaw, Director of Vehicle Attributes at Lotus, commented,\n“The Emira has a wider track than any recent Lotus road car, enhancing stability,\ndelivering exceptional road-holding and the sensation of a very low centre of gravity.\nIt is a true Lotus sports car that builds on the legacy of the Elise, Exige and Evora.”"

At the exclusive\nevent VIP guests were treated to passenger laps of the circuit with Gavan Kershaw\nat the wheel.\nThe culmination of more than 70 years of innovation on the road and track, the\nEmira GT4 marked the start of an exciting new era in performance GT racing for\nLotus. It was the first new model from Lotus Advanced Performance, the bespoke\nvehicle and experiential division of the business launched earlier in the year. The\nreturn to world motorsport is a key pillar of the company’s transformation from\na UK sports car company to a global performance car business and brand.\nLotus aimed to build a limited number of Type 131R Emira GT4 racecars for\nthe 2022 season, increasing production for 2023 in line\nwith global demand. Order books for the Emira GT4\nwhich had opened at the time, meant the car was almost\nimmediately sold out for the first year of production.\nGavan Kershaw commented: “We knew we had an\nexcellent starting point for the Emira GT4 because of\nall the work done to make the road car such a great\nperformer. Showing off the GT4’s dynamic capabilities\non the Hethel test track – which has shaped countless\nrace cars and their drivers since Lotus moved to the site\nin 1966 – is a very special moment for me and all the\nteam involved.”\nAlmost all modern Lotus road cars have had race-\nready siblings and the Emira is no exception. Each\nEmira GT4 customer would receive a homologated\nperformance machine, hand-built with lightweight\nmotorsport components and equipment to meet the\nlatest safety regulations.

The car\nThe all-new, all-electric, Lotus Eletre was, without doubt, a striking and progressive\naddition to the Sports Performance Utility Vehicle segment. It took the core principles\nand Lotus DNA from more than 70 years of sports car design and engineering, evolving\nthem into a desirable all-new lifestyle car for the next generation of Lotus customers.\nThe name Eletre means ‘coming to life’ in the Hungarian language, an appropriate\nname as the Eletre marked the start of a new chapter in the history of Lotus – the first\naccessible EV and the first SUV\n. Three versions of the new car were to be available, and\nall were 4WD. All had battery capacity over 100kWh, with a power range from 600hp.\nOn March 29th 2022, Lotus unvieled a bold\nnew dimension to their performance car portfolio,\nthe Type 132 Eletre. The Eletre delivered a\nsignificant number of firsts for Lotus – the first\nfive-door production car, the first model outside\nthe sports car segment, the first lifestyle EV, and\nthe most ‘connected’ Lotus ever built. However,\nit remained a true Lotus, packed with pioneering\ntechnology, sporting performance and simplicity\nof purpose.\nEletre\nType 132\nwas ‘Born British, Raised Globally’, with key attributes\ndefined by the development team at Hethel and the\noverall exterior and interior design led by an international\nteam based at the Lotus Technology Creative Centre in\nWarwickshire, UK. The unique Lotus ‘porous’ exterior\ndesign meant that air flowed through the vehicle for\nimproved aerodynamics, speed, range and overall\nefficiency. The design was led by Ben Payne, and his team\ncreated a daring and dramatic new model with a cab-\nforward stance, long wheelbase and very short overhangs\nfront and rear. Extensive use of carbon-fibre and\naluninium was specified for weight reduction throughout\nthe vehicle.\nA signature element of the design is its ‘porosity’ –\nthe aerodynamic principle of air flowing through the car\nas well as under, over and around it. Porosity was at the\nheart of the Evija’s design, was integral to the Emira, and\nprovided clear inspiration for the Eletre. It was most\nobvious where air was channelled under the leading edge\nof the car, emerging through two exit vents in the bonnet\nabove. There were other examples of porosity ahead of\nand behind the front wheel arches, behind the rear\nwheels, and even at the top of the D-pillar.\nMODEL\nType 132\nNAME/FORMULA\nEletre\nYEARS OF PRODUCTION\n2022\nEXAMPLES BUILT\ncurrently in production\nENGINE TYPE\nPure Electric 4WD\nBATTERY CAPACITY/POWER\n100kw/h+/600+bhp\nLENGTH/WIDTH/HEIGHT\n201in/88.0in/64.2in\nWHEELBASE\n118.8in\nWEIGHT\n4480lb/2032kg\n338"
