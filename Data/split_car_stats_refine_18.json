        "content": "In its famous, but soon to be lost green and yellow colors, Team Lotus fielded Hill in the International Spring Cup charity race at Oulton Park where he finished his first heat in fourth place. Sadly, an oil leak forced him out in the second heat. In the final, he was running in an impressive second place before mechanical problems relegated him to eighth. Of the 25 Formula 2 races held in 1967, Brabham scored the highest percentage of victories, with eleven wins. Against this, Lotus countered with five victories, four of them with the Type 48. Clark won three times (at Barcelona, Jarama, and Keimola), while Jackie Oliver scored the fourth Type 48 F2 class win at the Nürburgring German GP event, coming home fifth overall. Amazingly, this was the first-ever time he had been around the 'Ring. However, for most of 1967, Oliver campaigned in Formula 2 under the Lotus Components banner, driving the well-known black and white, uprated F3 Type 41B. Jim Clark also scored a solitary second place at Limbourg, and thirds at Karlskoga, Hameenlinna, and Albi. Graham Hill had a less successful season but gained several good placings: second at Snetterton, Silverstone.",

At the end of 1967, Lotus offered the Type 48 for sale to other teams at £5000, but a total of just four chassis would only ever be built, including the 'Team' cars. As there were no current Team Lotus F1 cars available in the UK (they were all on the other side of the world for the Tasman series), the Type 48 was used for the launch of the new Team Lotus sponsor package for 1968. Resplendent in the red, white, and gold of Players Gold Leaf cigarettes, the Type 48 had the distinction of being the car that started the sponsorship revolution that changed the face of motor racing. In 1968, Gold Leaf Team Lotus continued to campaign the Type 48, but the season started badly.",

In 1968, Gold Leaf Team Lotus continued to campaign the Type 48, but the season started badly with Jim Clark being tragically killed at the wheel of the 48 at Hockenheim in April. Graham Hill had no luck in the eight events in which he competed that year; his race at Crystal Palace famously ended with a wheel falling off. However, Oliver came second at Hockenheim and took fifth place in the championship for non-graded drivers. For 1967, the F2 regulations were revised from the previous 1000cc to accommodate engines up to 1600cc. The new Type 48 employed a conventional chassis, with a full monocoque center section and a spaceframe aft of the cockpit which carried the engine, transmission, and rear suspension, much like the Types 42 and 43. Power was supplied by the 1599cc Ford-Cosworth FVA twin overhead camshaft engine, which had a 16-valve head on a Ford block. The Cosworth engine was at that time unrivalled for both power and reliability.",

The Cosworth engine was unrivalled at that time for both power and reliability; it produced approximately 220bhp on Lucas fuel injection. Even Brabham deserted its previously dominant Honda engines in its favor. Unlike the majority of other Formula 2 constructors, who relied on Hewland FT200 transmissions, Lotus, after one sole outing with the old Hewland Mk5 box, elected to use the all-synchromesh ZF 5DS12 gearbox designed specifically for Formula 2 racing. The suspension followed the geometry of the F1 Type 33; at the front end, fabricated cantilever top wishbones operated on inboard coil-spring/damper units, while the bottom wishbone was wide-based, extending back well into the cockpit area. The rack-and-pinion steering was top-mounted with forward-facing steering arms. At the rear end, the twin radius rods were anchored in the monocoque immediately behind the driver, with the pickup points for the inverted bottom wishbones and single top links, and the outboard-angled coil-spring/damper units, located in a diaphragm section at the rear of the spaceframe.

The inboard locating lugs for the inverted bottom wishbones gave trouble initially, but were later strengthened by a bar between the two points, which transmitted the loads across the chassis. Girling alloy calipers were mounted outboard all round, tucked tightly within the magnesium knock-on wheels. Fuel was carried in rubber tanks alongside the driver with the dry sump reservoir located directly behind the oil and water radiators at the front of the car. The 'black box' transistor ignition was mounted above the ZF gearbox in a special housing to keep it as cool as possible. The Type 48's debut came in the Tasman series at the Australian Grand Prix at Warwick Farm. While Jim Clark stuck with his Formula 1 based Type 33, Graham Hill piloted the prototype 48 and was running in third place when the crownwheel and pinion of the Hewland Mk5 gearbox failed at around half-distance, the transaxle being insufficiently strong.",
