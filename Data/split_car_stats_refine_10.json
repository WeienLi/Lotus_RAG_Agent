Although several different types of BRM-built engines were seen in racing, no BRM Twin-cam engines were ever officially installed in Lotus road cars that came off the production line. The BRM engine did, however, find its way into an officially sanctioned, dealer version of the Series 3 Elan. Built in very limited numbers by the official Lotus dealer Mike Spence, these cars were recognizable by their dark green bodywork accentuated by bright orange bumpers at both front and rear. Under the bonnet, the major feature of the car, the re-worked Twin-cam engine, could be identified by a dark racing green cam-covers stamped with the words ‘BRM Racing’. The concept of the up-rated Twin-cam engine did, of course, re-surface a number of years later as the ‘Big Valve’ engine fitted to the ‘Elan Sprint’ series of cars. The Series 3 convertible, which from June 1966, was also available in the same Special Equipment form as the Coupé, continued pretty much without major change until March 1968.",

Unfortunately, that year Lotus would always be struggling in Formula 2, as it was up against the dominant Brabham-Hondas, who, with the high-revving advanced Japanese powerplant installed, were virtually invincible. The season began with Ron Harris' Team Lotus running its old Type 35s, but at Barcelona, the Type 44 made its debut with Jim Clark at the wheel. Essentially, it was an evolution of the Type 35, with its monocoque hull modified to accept wider 41-type suspension. The nose and tail body sections were grafted on from the Type 41, giving the new Type 44 a wider, lower profile, which many regard as one of the most graceful of all the Lotus types. At the front end, Lotus kept the system of inboard coil-spring/damper units and upper rocking arms. But the track was much wider, achieved by lengthening the upper arms and the lower wishbones.

This meant designing a new tubular spaceframe aft of the truncated monocoque to mount the engine, and since the V8 was far longer than the BRM H16, the wheelbase was extended by no less than ten inches. Another compromise was the fuel tank capacity: since there were originally no rear chassis legs to carry extra fuel, there was a sizeable tank behind the driver. Surprisingly, the extra length seemed to have a beneficial effect on handling. The revised chassis was called the 42F.

Its crankcase was also designed to act as a stressed member: the monocoque was truncated behind the cockpit and the engine/gearbox assembly was attached directly to the bulkhead, acting to take fairly substantial suspension loads. Double radius arms either side of the engine fed directly into pick-ups on the monocoque itself.

The double wishbone front suspension was basically the same as that on the Triumph Herald/Spitfire, while the front hubs and discs were those of the GT6/Vitesse. The steering rack was a lengthened version of the Elan/Herald unit. At the rear, and unusually for Lotus, substantial box-section radius arms pivoted on the backbone where the Y-fork divided. Deep uprights carried coil-spring/dampers and the outboard ends of wide lower links; the fixed-length Hooke-jointed drive-shafts acted to locate the wheels. A beam above the gearbox provided the location for the tops of the spring/damper units. Braking was by Girling discs up front, but there were Girling 8-inch drums at the rear, which were not mounted inboard but more conventionally near to the wheels. The wheels themselves were bolt-on early Elan-style steel discs with chrome hubcaps. The search for an engine with an integral transaxle led Lotus to Renault, which was amenable to supplying the all-alloy 1.5-litre engine and gearbox from its front-wheel-drive R16 model. The engine was placed in the center of the car.",

Placing the engine in the center of the car and reversing the gearbox was all that was needed to take the drive back to the rear wheels. Modifications to Lotus' requirements included a higher compression ratio, bigger inlet valves, and a twin-choke Solex carburettor, all for a net output of 78 bhp, nearly 20 bhp more than standard. The choice of French mechanicals raised some eyebrows in Britain, but it was a sensible choice considering the intended target market of the European mainland.\n\nOn the Series 1 car, the glass-fiber bodywork was bonded onto the chassis for strength, although this made repair and restoration nearly impossible. The styling was by John Frayling and somewhat controversially incorporated a 'breadvan' rear end. The shape was exceptionally aerodynamic—some sources suggest a Cd figure of 0.29, others 0.32.

Because the side windows had a double-curvature, they had to be fixed in position and to get ventilation into the cabin, the front luggage bay was pressurized and forced air was fed in via Renault butterfly nozzles in the dash. Although the semi-reclining seats were fixed, there was some pedal adjustment and a Triumph adjustable steering column to help get the driving position just right. Luggage space was fair at 4.8 cubic feet in the nose and tail (a somewhat hot space). The press was shown the 'Europe' in December 1966 and full production began in the new year.

True to its name, the Series 1 Europa was initially intended to only be sold on the continent, but this of course was soon revised to allow eager UK customers to buy into the bold new style of Lotus. Press reports were enthusiastic about the unparalleled handling. The top speed was a more-than-respectable 115 mph, but overall the chassis was capable of handling much more power (a criticism, of course, addressed by the later Twin-Cam model). The Europa certainly had its faults, including a very cramped cockpit with poor pedal location, a very heavy clutch, imprecise gear changing, and abysmal visibility to the rear. The Europa S1 was essentially a car inspired by racing practice and not ideal as a road-going machine. It certainly lacked the broad appeal of the Elan.\n\nAs previously mentioned, initially Lotus announced that the first 500 cars would be earmarked for French Lotus dealers only and priced at 20,000 Francs each, which was considerably less than an Elan. However, this was never really the case. The Europa Series 1 chassis number sequence ended in 1968 at number 0644, when the Series 1 model was replaced by the Series 2.",

Two new cars were constructed for 1968 and raced under the new Gold Leaf Team Lotus banner. These team cars, designated 47A, were very different from their predecessors, with a body unit that was completely detachable from the strengthened chassis. Much to John Miles' displeasure, the temperamental Tecalemit-Jackson fuel injection system was retained, despite the total loss by fire of the prototype car at Brands Hatch in 1967. The revised car was not only reliable but exceedingly quick, as was shown by the ten new circuit lap records set during the 1968 season.\n\nFor 1968, the car theoretically became a sports car (rather than a GT) by reason of its homologation as a Group 4 vehicle within Appendix J. The Gold Leaf Team Lotus drivers for 1968 were once again John Miles and Jackie Oliver, with occasional appearances by Trevor Taylor and Tim Schenken. Miles won the 2-litre class in the John Player Trophy race at Silverstone and came second in the International Trophy at the same circuit. Oliver won his class in the Guards Trophy at Brands and again at Croft.\n\nThe car stats are as follows: Model Type 47, Name/Formula Group 4 Sports Racer, Years of Production 1966-68, Examples Built 71 (total Type 47), Engine Type Cosworth-Ford Twin-cam DOHC, Engine Size/Power 1594cc/165bhp, Length/Width/Height 156in/66in/40in, Wheelbase 91in, Weight 1230lb/558kg.",

A total of 71 chassis were recorded as being built, but only the two 1968 team cars were designated as a Type 47A (photographed here). Although contemporary ads implied that two others were built, this has never been confirmed. Of the rest, seven chassis were designated 47Fs and fitted with Cortina engines and Renault gearboxes, and five were replacement chassis body units.\n\nWhile the basic Europa chassis layout remained, it was a more lightweight affair with a deeper front T-section and shorter rear Y-arms and a welded box-section cross-member. The suspension, too, was broadly similar to the Europa’s, but at the rear end it incorporated new light alloy uprights from the Type 59, separate upper tubular links, reversed lower wishbones, longer upper and lower trailing arms, and full Rose jointing.

Girling brake discs were fitted to all four wheels, complete with an adjustable front/rear balance bar.

Private owners preferred Weber carburettors or, occasionally, Lucas injection. Cooling was by a crossflow water radiator and separate oil cooler, both mounted in the front compartment.
