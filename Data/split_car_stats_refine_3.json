However, in tests it appeared that cooling was insufficient in high ambient temperatures, and the clean nose line soon had to be modified to receive a radiator canted over and mounted within a top-ducted nose cone. The Type 70 used the same track/wheelbase ratio as the company’s 1967 Formula 1 car, Type 49B. It also mimicked this car’s innovative construction, using the engine as a stressed chassis element with the water radiator, engine, and transmission oil coolers located aft.\n\nIn June 1969, Lotus decided to enter Formula 5000, or Formula A as it was known in the USA. With the new car scheduled to make its debut at September’s Riverside race in California, this gave the design team just ten weeks to design and build a completely new car, the Type 70.

Designed by Martin Waide, the Type 70 actually used a far simpler chassis than the Type 49. Colin Chapman had insisted that the car be readily maintained by ‘the average racing mechanic’ and as a result, it comprised twin side boxes of 16 and 18-gauge aluminum sheet with an 18-gauge aluminum undertray. Mild steel bracing, which doubled up as mounts for various smaller components, and complex folds on the inner surfaces of the side bays provided much of the stiffness. In place of conventional bulkheads, the monocoque terminated with a flat panel behind the seat and a mild steel box up front.\n\nPower came from a Shelby-modified Ford Boss 302 V8, which formed the rear part of the car by virtue of being bolted directly onto the monocoque, with the rear suspension load carried via the bell housing and beefy Hewland LG600 gearbox.

The gearbox from Hewland and the engine, Cosworth's 3-litre DFV, remained open to the elements.

The big valve cars' price had jumped from £2375 when it was launched in early 1969 to £2676, but the 25 percent power boost did increase performance to a top speed of just under 125mph, and a genuine 0-60mph capability of less than 7.5 seconds. Lotus brochures in 1971 were again quick to use Lotus racing heritage to promote the new model; \"Taking its place alongside vehicles costing twice the price, sharing their social acceptance, while rivalling their performance and durability, the +2S130 has all the design experience and engineering integrity that you would expect from a manufacturer with World Championship traditions to maintain\" was how the +2S130 was promoted. Another hoped-for optional extra, a five-speed gearbox, was introduced in October 1972, cars so fitted being named +2S130/5.

It was thus of the monocoque type, fabricated in aluminum alloy with two main side sponsons containing rupture-proof fuel cells. Four-wheel drive enabled the car to run identical suspension fore and aft: spring and damper assemblies mounted well inboard and operated by rocking arm extensions of the top wishbones.\n\nThe Formula One Pratt & Whitney engine was also very similar to its Indy predecessor, using an STN76 turbine with a single axial compressor stage and a centrifugal stage feeding an annular compressor.

The fabricated double wishbone front suspension operated inboard torsion bars and dampers, while at the rear, there was a more conventional coil spring/damper set up. The disc brakes were inboard at all four corners, and the side-mounted radiators for oil and water were fitted almost flush to the sides of the monocoque. Power came from the Lotus Type 906 alloy block, a twin overhead camshaft unit of 1,973cc and, some said, a derivation of its production engine, itself based on the cast iron General Motors/Vauxhall Victor unit that had already been extensively modified by Novamotor.

Eventually, with the two ‘stars’ of the Formula One team, Emerson Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson behind the wheel, a matching pair of Type 74s were rolled out for the Formula 2 race at Nivelles, Belgium in mid-June.",

The engines were completely rebuilt by Norfolk-based Norvic Racing Engines before their next outing at Rouen in France. In a desperate attempt to make the cars more competitive, they tried different nose profiles, including a 'Type 72' nose and one very similar to that used on Emerson Fittipaldi’s Bardhal Type 69 Formula 2 car. Despite crashing at Rouen, Peterson managed to record the fastest lap before retiring, leaving teammate Fittipaldi still running but destined to remain unplaced at the finish. After missing the Monza race, the twin Texaco Stars made their next appearance at Misano, only to retire with engine problems.

In fact, the Elite retained the traditional Lotus combination of backbone chassis and GRP bodywork but still successfully represented a major departure from the company’s established kit-car heritage. Indeed, supplied only as a finished car, it was priced at a comparatively high £5,445 when customer cars finally went on sale in January of the following year.\n\nDesigner Oliver Winterbottom’s fashionable and aerodynamic wedge-shaped lines, a complex confection of curves and straights, squared edges and smooth panels, gave the Elite an excellent coefficient of drag and a highly distinctive and modern appearance.

In appearance, it was a slightly angular, 'delta' shaped car, further distinguished by the rakish aesthetics of its high air collector and an unusual bi-plane rear wing.

In Spain, Peterson again led the race, but the cars were still far from sorted, and once more he retired with brake difficulties and another engine failure.

Launched in October 1975, its manufacture continued to employ Chapman’s revolutionary Vacuum Assisted Resin Injection, a system first perfected for the Elite. Once again, it was a car built in two halves with a useful rubbing strip fitted to the car’s flanks in order to conceal the join. The chief difference between this and the Elite was to be found in the upper half of the mould. While the lower half of the bodyshell remained essentially the same, above the 'join' the roofline plunged deeply into a fastback tail – the car had originally been conceived and for a time was known in Lotus circles as the Elite Coupé – even though it terminated with a conventional bootlid instead of the Elite’s 'hatchback' arrangement.

As such, it was something of an interim measure, built to 'hold the fort' during the 1976 season, while work continued apace on the forthcoming but still top-secret Type 78. \n\nBased on a particularly slim aluminium monocoque designed by Geoff Aldridge, the Type 77 was the work of a team assembled under Peter Warr and comprising Aldridge, Mike Cooke, and Martin Ogilvie. The challenge was to clear away memories of the underwhelming Type 76 and to devise a workable and competitive, if temporary, replacement for the increasingly geriatric Type 72. \n\nAt this time, the lengthy road circuits of the 1960s were being replaced by shorter, tighter circuits, a move which called for an entirely new approach to racing car design. Colin Chapman's solution was adjustable suspension, variable in both track and wheelbase as well as in several other key respects.

Unquestionably one of the show's real stars, the new car was nevertheless painfully slow to develop, with that effort taking place over a two-year time span. The first pre-production prototype did not appear until late 1974, but the announcement of the production model itself was left until the following October. That made it almost three years since Giugiaro's exciting design had caught the public mood at Turin. The many well-publicized financial difficulties at Lotus conspired to slow the progress yet again, so that production of the Esprit did not start until well into 1976. However, unwelcome the record-breaking four-year gestation period was to prove, the mere fact that the car's design was still widely applauded when it finally went on sale says a lot for the enduring appeal of Giugiaro's original and futuristic 1972 design study.\n\nAt the Turin motor show in November 1972, Giorgetto Giugiaro's Ital Design studio had shown a stunning silver mid-engined concept car developed in close liaison with Lotus.

It appeared every bit as extraordinary as rival Bertone’s earlier, yet still truly radical, mid-engined (Lancia) Stratos show car. Mechanically, there was little to surprise the seasoned Lotus-watcher as yet another Lotus production car appeared using the familiar steel backbone chassis, this time with the forked section at the back and with the cross-member up at the front. In naming the car, Lotus continued with its alliterative tradition of leading with the letter ‘E’ and, to many ears, acquitted themselves successfully after the earlier choice of the somewhat awkward moniker given to the Éclat. The Esprit, while still a close-coupled two-seater, was intended from the start to be a larger, more usable machine than the pretty but occasionally claustrophobic Europa. Accordingly, the principal dimensions of the backbone chassis and cross-members were exaggerated in order to give the finished car a more spacious and roomy interior.

Inspiration for the car came from many sources, notable among them the inner wing section of the deHavilland Mosquito, and Rudd set out to devise a car which used its entire form to shape its aerodynamics instead of one which sought merely to compensate for an aerodynamically redundant shape by adding wings in the conventional manner. Maximum downforce with minimum drag became the team's new Holy Grail. The resulting monocoque was as slim as that fitted to the Type 77, but with wide panniers either side, a structural top panel above the driver's legs and, for the first time at Lotus, its construction made extensive use of Cellite, a sandwich of super-thin Dural panels enclosing a complex aluminum honeycomb.

DeHavilland-style leading-edge intakes fed cool air in, with hot air exiting through top ducts. These, and other modifications, like the endplate bristle-skirt which extended down to track level, functioned to generate two distinctly separate airflow patterns – one beneath the car and another around its upper and side surfaces. The result of all this development work, much of it carried out at the Imperial College wind-tunnel and led by chief-aerodynamicist Peter Wright, was an artificially-created drop in air pressure beneath the car which literally sucked the car down onto the track. Assisted by conventional wings and fins to provide additional stability and balance at speed, the Type 78 was shaping up to be a formidable machine.

The top speed claim remained at 138 mph, but the most noticeable driving change was apparently enhanced cross-wind stability, provided by the integrated front spoiler. The new Lotus-designed, 4-spoke Speedline wheels were a little wider (7-inch front and 7.5-inch rear) than the Series 1, and partly in an effort to alleviate the lack of space under the front bonnet and partly to save costs, a smaller 'get you home' spare wheel was adopted. Other external changes included the use of black chip-resistant paint on the front spoiler, sill, and valance, and the addition of protruding engine air intakes positioned just behind the rear quarter windows.

This time, Colin and his team opted for huge bolt-on fibreglass side-pods, so that from above the square-cut machine formed a perfect rectangle. Each pod was configured to act as a giant venturi, with the air entering at the front and accelerating to exit at the rear, where skirts sealed the U-shaped section to maintain the integrity of the underbody low-pressure area.

Subject to later revision, the brakes were initially placed inboard at the rear and outboard at the front.\n\nKeen to maximise negative lift while minimising drag, Colin had opted for a long nose section with the side skirts extending the entire length of the curved body sides, with only minimal breaks to allow for the suspension. It became clear in early testing, however, that these skirts would be the source of many problems. Pitching of the nose – known as 'porpoising' – was an enduring problem.",

Pitching of the nose – known as ‘porpoising’, an enduring problem with rival Niki Lauda’s Brabham BT48 as well – damaged the front sections of each skirt. In addition, the main skirts frequently stuck in their housings if one end lifted significantly relative to the other. In this way, downforce would be lost, being restored suddenly and at the most unpredictable moments – in other words, just when the driver was least expecting it. As always, the team was ready with a pragmatic solution, quickly modifying the skirts and applying wings to the nose section in time for Andretti’s teammate Carlos Reutemann to test the car at Donington. By the time the car was readied for the re-scheduled Race of Champions in mid-April, it had gained a rear wing also, although oil-spill problems forced Andretti back into his Type 79 for the race itself.

The most significant change, however, was the installation of a Garrett Ai Research turbocharger mounted behind the cylinder block and above the clutch bell-housing. Intended to boost the engine’s power output to an impressive 210bhp at 6,250rpm (and requiring a one-inch wider clutch to be fitted along with larger, non-ventilated brakes), the addition heralded the arrival of the Esprit as a genuine 150mph+ Lotus supercar. With two small exceptions, the top half of the Giugiaro body shape (above the black trim-line joining strip) remained nearly unchanged, but the lower half received a re-vamp with the addition of a new wrap-around front bumper and spoiler assembly, new sideskirts, and a pair of NACA-type ducts in the sills to provide additional engine cooling.

To avoid confusion, it should be noted that while similar in many respects to the Type 911 engine developed for the Sunbeam Lotus rally car project, this was for Lotus an entirely new engine. In fact, the 912 engine offered no more power than its predecessor—peak output was still 160bhp, but it was available at 6,500rpm instead of the older engine’s 6,200—but it gained much needed torque and this was available across a wider spread of the vehicle’s range.

In addition, the turbocharged cars of another team, Renault, were soon threatening to render uncompetitive the normally-aspirated Cosworth DFVs of teams like Lotus.\n\nAgainst this background, Colin abandoned attempts to develop the Type 80 to a point where it would be truly competitive. After FISA moved to ban sliding skirts, Lotus instead began a search for a magic ingredient to resolve the mutual incompatibility of suspension requirements between those parts of the car which affect its aerodynamics and those parts which insulate the driver from the road shocks.

In a December issue of a magazine, it was stated, \"The Lotus 86 has been built to comply with the rules as written, and there is little doubt that an attempt will be made to get those rules re-written to render it (the new car) illegal.\" Colin Chapman likely felt the same way but was still convinced that he would eventually be able to justify a practical racing version of the car.",

Prices dropped too. By October 1982, the price of the then-equivalent Éclat S2.2 was nudging £15,000 – a high price at a time when would-be customers were cutting back in a bid to survive a recession – but as a direct consequence of the co-operation with Toyota, the new Excel cut this price markedly, shaving well over £1,000 off the total price to a much more competitive £13,787.

So it was that he decided to incorporate into the new Type 92 a computer-controlled 'active' suspension system that Team Lotus had had under development for so long. This system, while comparatively heavy with around 20 kilograms of hardware and requiring an additional 1.5 gallons of hydraulic fluid, was certainly clever. Designed and developed in partnership with Britain's Cranfield College of Aeronautics, it featured hydraulic rams on all four corners which were powered by a small centrally-located engine-driven pump. These rams effectively replaced the springs, anti-roll bars, and dampers and were controlled from a central processing unit (CPU) which received telemetric data from a battery of accelerometers as well as load sensors and transducers mounted on each ram. By analyzing the electronic input from these sensors, the CPU was able to build a 'picture' of the vehicle's movements and attitudes. Receiving signals back from the CPU, the suspension rams were then able to react almost instantaneously by extending or shortening the suspension travel to optimize the chassis attitude and control.",

The entire ensemble was then, in the words of the factory press handout, \"literally baked at 125C.\" The team also announced a switch to radial-ply Pirellis, to Elf lubricants, and to Champion spark plugs, but of course, the most important new ingredient was that designated by the suffix 'T' – Renault's V6, 90-degree 1,492cc EF1 engine, with twin KKK turbochargers.",

With the factory working double shifts seven days a week, the new cars were readied for the all-important British Grand Prix. Substantially different from the car it replaced, the Type 94T had new suspension (abandoning the pull-rod design), new bodywork, new gearbox, even new pedals. That said, it retained the impressively strong carbon-fibre/Kevlar chassis, and the means of production remained much as before. It also retained much that had served to distinguish the earlier Type 91, Ducarouge having realized that to meet the extremely short deadline, he needed to adapt something from somewhere. The smaller and more compact Type 91 monocoque was chosen over its immediate descendants. The Type 91’s design allowed for easy removal of the front and rear bulkheads, the latter of which proved easy to adapt to take the altered mountings for the Renault V6. The fuel cell was also modified to include a different breather and filler neck designed to suit the new system of mid-race refuelling stops. Revised positioning of the intercoolers and radiators made for different weight distribution while a completely new car was born.",

Mansell, however, was less happy; his car having been completed only the day before the British GP, and still suffering from a rash of electrical gremlins. For practice, he chose to return to the Type 93T and qualified 18th, while De Angelis stormed in close behind the leaders to qualify fourth.

Ducarouge sought only to devise a car that would be both light and easy to drive. With smaller sidepods and relocated ancillaries, hence the taller, slimmer shape, the car's suspension was virtually unchanged from the Type 93T's pull-rod arrangement. But it now employed new Brembo brakes from Italy and also saw a return to Goodyear tyres. Substantial use of carbon-fibre and Kevlar, by now something of a Lotus standard, ensured the car was down to the 540 kg minimum weight limit.

Unveiled on December 20th, 1983, at the impressive Lotus France showroom near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the new smaller and lighter John Player Special liveried Type 95T was the company’s third-generation turbocharged Formula 1 contender. Though less powerful than some of its closest rivals, it was still an impressive engine. The new regulation for fuel tank allowance (now cut to 220 litres for the entire race and no refuelling) meant that its fuel economy took on even more importance. There were concerns that the Goodyear radials might not be fully competitive with the Michelins run by the all-conquering McLarens—an important consideration when weighing up the benefits of hard and soft tyres and the resulting impact on pit lane strategies—but against this, there seemed little doubt that the Type 95T",

Nigel Mansell was forced to retire in Brazil, in South Africa, and at Detroit, as well as in front of his home crowd, yet he took a good third in France, two places ahead of De Angelis, and was actually leading his first GP at Monaco before charging too hard in the wet, losing control, and crashing out.

In 1984, Formula 1 saw the Type 95T. The reasons are, inevitably, numerous. For much of the season, the drivers seemed to compete more with each other than with their rivals. Neither seemed able to bring as much to the Type 95T as it seemed to give to them. And, crucially, the formidable power and very real potential of the Renault V6 was sometimes squandered and lost, its high fuel consumption forcing drivers on occasions to avoid using full turbocharger boost in order to ensure they conserved sufficient fuel to reach the finish. Incredibly, all four cars built with this designation were to survive the 16-race season intact. Over the year, they had taken pole position twice and started from the front row no fewer than six times.
