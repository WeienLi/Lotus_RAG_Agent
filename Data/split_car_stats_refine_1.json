        "content": "When the post-war UK fuel ration was abolished in 1947, Colin's career as a novice car dealer came to an abrupt end. With more time to work on the car in between his undergraduate lectures at London University, the car really began to take shape. The chassis was scraped clean, then checked, painted, and given boxed main members by welding a fourth side to the 'U' section, or 'top hat', chassis rails. Colin did most of the work but was helped by his car sales partner Colin Dare, Derek Wootton, and girlfriend Hazel Williams. The facilities were basic in the extreme, so the end product reflected the lack of power tools, with just one borrowed electric drill, and the absence of panel-beating expertise; any brazing had to be done by a local welder. The bodywork was very angular, created by using aluminium-bonded plywood panels, no doubt the result of experience gained through Colin’s University College engineering course. The body was constructed of angular panels with contoured edges. The rear end was extended so that two passengers, more commonly known as trials ballast, could easily be accommodated, and it was topped off with a hinged lid. There were no doors, merely cut-outs.",

There were no doors, merely cut-outs in the body sides. The radiator surround was fashioned out of copper sheet and looked rather like a Rolls-Royce grille. Colin’s learning curve throughout the whole process reflected his innate engineering aptitude and natural talent for innovation on the cheap. One example of this was a clever design to overcome the Austin’s unfortunate habit of over-steering on corners as a result of the rear quarter-elliptic springs flattening as the body rolled. As his car was now going to be a trials car, he could not adopt the accepted solution to this problem, which was to replace the elliptic springs with flattened ones, because it reduced ground clearance to an unacceptable level. Instead, by swapping the axle casings from side to side and turning them upside down, he found a way to fit the flattened springs and still have adequate ground clearance. Problem solving like this was to become the rule.",

Problem solving like this was to become the rule rather than the exception. Special actuating cams were fitted to the brakes and the linkage was modified. The Austin engine was completely overhauled, given a higher compression ratio, and a specially made inlet manifold was fitted with double valve springs. The weak Austin carburettor was swapped for a Ford downdraught type. After a year of work, the Austin Special [PK 3493] was completed in the spring of 1948, and Colin immediately took part in a number of trials accompanied by Hazel as a passenger. However, this competition experience revealed some minor weaknesses in the car. The rear end needed larger section tyres, so Ford steel disc wheels were substituted for the Austin Seven wire wheels.

By now, Colin had noticed that Austin Seven power was not really competitive in these events, and he quickly embarked on the construction of his next project, a Ford-engined car, and the first one to be called a Lotus (subsequently named the Mark II). It was not until after his Lotus Mk II was sold to Mike Lawson that Chapman decided to call his first car the Lotus Mark I (a reconstruction of which is pictured above), and his second the Mark II. Thus, the first car to have the word Lotus on the drawings before construction began would be the Mark III.

As on the Mark I, the main Austin Seven chassis members were boxed-in, but the cross-members were removed and replaced with tubes welded in position. This provided a lightweight but stiff frame. Colin used the Ford split front axle, fitted with bushes and suspended from the front of the Austin Seven A-frame. However, he did not want to use the heavy Ford rear axle, preferring the lighter Austin Seven unit which was easier to connect to the four-speed Austin Seven gearbox that he used in place of the three-speed Ford unit. Not satisfied that the standard axle ratios were high enough for his use, he famously devised a way to increase the ratio. He used the 42-tooth crown wheel from one axle type, mated to the 9-tooth pinion of the other type, then filled the differential not with oil but with Bluebell metal polish. It was run for 50 miles in this fashion, and then pulled apart. The bearings had been destroyed but the crown wheel and pinion now meshed perfectly.",

It was in the engine department that Colin’s genius for speed was realized to the greatest extent. The standard Austin Seven engine had ‘siamesed’ inlet ports (that is, one port serving two cylinders), and Colin saw an immediate way to get more power out of the engine by the process of ‘de-siamesing’. This involved enlarging the openings in the cylinder block and fitting a dividing plate which was welded with bronze filler and meticulously shaped with rotary files, creating a separate passage to each inlet valve.

The adapted inlet manifold was fitted with a huge Stromberg twin-choke carburetor taken from a Ford V8 engine, each choke being mated to its corresponding port on the manifold, thereby achieving the effect of a twin-carburetor system. The result was a hugely powerful ‘standard’ 747cc engine, with a top speed recorded at Silverstone in excess of 90 mph and a 0-50 mph acceleration time of just 6.6 seconds.

The solution was an angled ‘snorkel’ air intake, which, in ignorance of the de-siamesing, other 750MC competitors copied, thinking it was a clever Colin Chapman device for extracting more horsepower! A three-bearing engine was later used to solve the problem of bent connecting rods and oil-starved big end bearings. This engine had to be mounted on rubber mountings to stop the crankcase from twisting and the crankshaft breaking. This deprived the front of the chassis frame of rigidity, which, in turn, lowered cornering speed. The solution was bracing made with 14-gauge welded tubes that formed a cage-like triangulation around the engine.

The engine and gearbox were set well back in the chassis to keep as much weight as possible over the rear wheels, and the gaping hole between engine and radiator was filled by another novel feature: two large Jerry cans filled with water. Unlike most trials cars, the Mark IV was a true dual-purpose car; it could be driven to the start of the event with the handling of a normal car. Once the Jerry cans were removed, the trial could be tackled with handling characteristics ideal for trials, but which made for tricky handling on normal roads.

There was also a panel in the tail for access to the final drive and inboard brakes. The production chassis was a further minor development of the Mark VI tubular frame, being shorter than the Mark VIII’s (although on the same wheelbase) and, as modified for the enveloping bodywork, had lighter gauge tubing in some areas. In January of 1955, Colin Chapman gave up his job at British Aluminium and committed himself to working full-time at Lotus. One of the first tasks for the year was to address a demand for a more advanced Mark VIII, with a smaller engine. Low weight and advanced aerodynamics remained the goals, and Frank Costin’s brief was to design a body that would fit inside the new transporter, so the Mark IX had to be a full two feet shorter. At the start of the season, the first two production cars used Alfin aluminium brake drums, but these were later replaced by an in-house design using cast Elektron drums with fins which fitted more tightly inside.",

In preparation for the 1955 season, Colin Chapman addressed customer demands for a Mark VIII with a larger engine by producing the Mark X. In fact, Colin was so enthusiastic about the project that this actually preceded the production development of the Mark IX. The 2-litre class was growing extremely popular, and the most successful cars (Cooper, Tojeiro, and Lister) used Bristol's 2-litre six-cylinder engine, a British-built version of the pre-war BMW 328 OHV engine that, with its triple Solex carburettors, could produce up to 125 bhp.

The Bristol unit was much more powerful than any engine yet fitted to a Lotus chassis, and in such a lightweight setting, obviously had tremendous potential. The Mark VIII based spaceframe had to be modified to enlarge the engine bay, and the problem of installing and removing the engine was solved by making two chassis members detachable. To offset the effect of the heavier engine up front, optimum weight distribution was achieved by placing the fuel tank behind the rear axle, along with the twin fuel pumps, the spare wheel, and the battery. It was decided to have a similar rear end layout that the Mark IX had employed—a de Dion axle with upright coil-spring/damper units. Chapman was concerned that the Mark VIII’s Lockheed Alfin drum brakes would be insufficient, so for this iteration, he chose the latest Dunlop disc brakes, mounted outboard with the wheels at the front and inboard alongside the differential at the rear.

Even using one chassis design, there could still be a wide variation in specification depending on the car’s intended use. Hence, the Eleven was developed as a direct descendant of the Mark IX. The new type number was Mark XI, but the Press soon latched on to the way \"Eleven\" rolled off the tongue. With the added complication that 11 could be confused for '2', Colin decided to dispense with the 'Mark' designation. The engine was mounted over the Girling dampers nearer the centre of the car. The rack-and-pinion steering was extremely narrow to line up with the axle pivot axis, and specially cut steering arms lowered the track rods.\n\nIn profile, the Frank Costin-honed Eleven was the smoothest Lotus yet. While the scuttle was the same height as the Mark IX, the bonnet and tail were more steeply raked, and the tail fins were reduced in height. If a stabilising effect was required for high-speed tracks, a head fairing could be added together with a metal tonneau cover, producing the \"single seat\" version.

The Seven was not a direct follow-on from the Mark VI – with the works over-stretched building race cars, there was a gap of some two years between the end of Mark VI production and the launch of the Seven – but it was its spiritual successor, resembling it closely.

Ultimately, however, nobody received their kit until well into the spring of 1958. By the time the first customers were building up their kits, Colin Chapman (seen below left with the prototype Seven and Elite just visible) was already thinking about more power for the little sports car. A Coventry Climax engine had been fitted to the early pre-production car, and a handful of these were made to special order. In December 1958, a production version was offered with this engine. This was the legendary 'Super Seven', later also known as the Seven C. The Super Seven had a close-ratio Austin A30 four-speed gearbox and, with the 1098cc engine developing 75bhp, its maximum speed was comfortably over 100mph, with 0-60mph taking only 9.2 seconds.

It cost about £120 more than the standard car, which would soon become known as the Seven F.\n\nIntroduced the following year at the Motor Show was the Lotus Seven A, with the BMC 948cc engine taken from the Austin A35/Morris Minor. Producing 37bhp, this engine was a little more powerful than the Ford side-valve but was a lot more tuneable. It also formed the basis of the export Seven 'America', which used a 43bhp Austin-Healey Sprite A-Series engine. To satisfy American legislation, the 'America' did away with the non-swivelling front cycle wings in favor of sweeping wings—a modification which was soon to become standard for domestic models, too.\n\nWith production of the Elite delayed, the Seven took on an unexpected mantle as Lotus' main road car effort, and about 60 cars were built during 1958.

This used a minimum of components, but its geometry was so sound that the same design was used for almost twenty years on his small single-seaters, and all versions of the Seven. The clever part of the design was to integrate the anti-roll bar with the top-link, thus forming an upper wishbone. Colin Chapman had used swing axle front suspension on all his cars to date, but in the back of his mind, he had a concern that the gyroscopic effects of the front wheels would cause unwanted steering effects as the speed of the cars increased. Even though at the end of 1956, when the Eleven S1 record breaker had lapped Monza at over 140 mph, neither driver was on record as complaining about the stability. The 1957 Series 2 Eleven Sports racing car, with the new wishbone front suspension carried over from the Type 12, was designed to accept a range of engines, but this time the new Formula 2 twin-cam Coventry Climax FPF was an official factory option. In order to accommodate this particular 145 bhp unit, the following car stats were recorded:",

Other dimensions were left mainly the same. In practice, almost every other component of the 1956 design was altered, making an obvious basis for a Type 13. However, superstition reigned, and the 1957 car was given the name 'Eleven Series 2'. At this point, the 1956 car began to be known as the Series 1. Major changes for the Series 2, apart from the much lighter wishbone suspension, consisted of a larger diameter de Dion tube with more substantial rear hub castings, plus a more bulbous body in the area of both front and rear wheel arches. At the rear, the bodywork was modified to accommodate the larger 550 section tyres fitted to the Climax FPF-powered version.

Apart from the front suspension, a second major feature carried over from the Type 12 was the option of the magnesium Wobbly Web wheels, which gave a useful reduction in unsprung weight.

However, experience soon revealed that the handling was affected appreciably by the changing load of the rear-mounted fuel tank. As a result, a new suspension system was devised by Colin, called the 'Chapman Strut'. There were essentially three members: the driveshaft, which located each wheel laterally, a single forward-facing radius arm, and the strut member (coil-spring and damper). These three converged into an aluminium casting containing two wheel bearings. The driveshaft was angled up by three degrees to provide slight negative camber. This arrangement benefited both unsprung and overall weight and reduced to a minimum the camber changes caused by fuel loading, making handling predictable.\n\nAt the front end was a double wishbone set-up with the top wishbone doubling as an anti-roll bar, plus coil-spring/damper units. This set-up had become the characteristic Lotus independent front end for a whole generation of Lotus cars.

The five-speed transaxle gearbox was developed by Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy, and the propshaft was set so low that it passed under the driver's seat. Gear changes were accomplished rather like they were in early motorcycles, via a zig-zag gate, which was perhaps the car's major failing. Some at Lotus even dubbed it the 'queerbox'. Gears could not be cut quickly enough in Britain, so Colin Chapman ordered these from ZF in Germany, as well as limited-slip differentials.

The shape was designed with minimal frontal area, and the radiator was inclined back to reduce the height of the bonnet line. In order to keep unsprung weight down, a different type of wheel was chosen, namely bolt-on (rather than knock-on) magnesium alloy disc wheels. It was preferable to keep the thickness of the alloy as thin as possible, yet it also needed to be strong, so a web pattern was devised. The bending strength of the wheel varied as the folds became deeper towards the center of the hub and shallower towards the rims.

At the rear, a triangular box provided attachment points for the final drive and suspension; the propshaft tunnel, sills, and roof provided front-to-rear stressed sections.

The best result, however, was the private entry number 41 car of Peter Lumsden and Peter Riley, which came home in a splendid eighth overall and first in the 1500cc class. At an average speed of a little over 94 mph, it was a pretty impressive performance for a car of just 1216cc.",

The chassis-frame was wider and lower than the Type 12, and again used Reynolds round-edge bottom longerons, and square uprights up front to enable easier suspension mounting. The frame was mainly formed of 20-gauge tubing with some 18-gauge members, welded together by Progress Chassis Company. At the rear, an unusual rubber sling supported the weight of both the fuel and oil tanks. Unlike the Vanwall, the new Type 16 was extremely low, achieved by seating the driver on the undertray and inclining the Climax FPF engine at 62 degrees – almost completely on its side – rather like in the Type 15. Additionally, it was offset 5½ degrees from the center line of the car so that the propshaft could run to the left of the driver.

Overall height, and therefore frontal area, was reduced by laying the dry-sumped twin-cam Climax engine virtually on its side, just degrees from the horizontal. The double-curvature windscreen was smoothly moulded in one piece, and a lipped top edge to the screen helped to reduce drag still further. The body featured a very smooth undertray and hinged front and rear ends, which could be quickly removed.

Because the gearbox was rear-mounted there was plenty of space for the pedals, which were wide-spaced.

Although very different from the 1959 Lotus 16, the overall concept of the Type 18 was still typically Lotus. This included a spaceframe chassis, with the forward section fully triangulated and in itself a complete structure, which carried mountings for the front suspension, pedals, brake and clutch master cylinders, and steering rack. Forward of this braced section was a separate, lighter frame carrying the water and oil radiators, and oil tanks. The centre of the chassis was marked by a Lotus feature, a fabricated sheet and tube scuttle frame which eliminated the need for cross bracing. This formed a convenient and well-supported area to mount the instruments, steering column, gear lever, and other switchgear. The central part of the chassis, braced on three sides only but drawing torsional rigidity from the structures around it, connected the scuttle hoop to the engine bulkhead. The rear chassis had an easily removable Y-shaped diagonal section.",

The central part of the chassis, braced on three sides only but drawing torsional rigidity from the structures around it, connected the scuttle hoop to the engine bulkhead. The rear chassis had an easily removable Y-shaped diagonal section which braced the engine bay. The front suspension was by unequal length double wishbones, with the latest modifications of a separate anti-roll bar and easily adjustable camber angle. There was insufficient height at the rear to install the familiar strut suspension, so Colin designed an entirely new 'double transverse link' arrangement, formed by the lower tubular links and the unsplined driveshafts. Parallel radius arms ran rearward from the engine bulkhead to the bottom and center of the upright.\n\nFollowing the lead set by Cooper, the obvious answer was to put the engine behind the driver, whose size would then dictate the frontal area of the car. The rear-engined layout had been well proven, and Colin felt sure he could improve on what he considered their rudimentary suspension designs. Colin always said he regarded the Type 18 as the first true Formula 1 car he had designed and built, his previous front-engined car being less advanced.",

The rear-engined layout had been well proven, and Colin felt sure he could improve on what he considered their rudimentary suspension designs. Colin always said he regarded the Type 18 as the first true Formula 1 car he had designed and built; his previous front-engined efforts being merely dabbling, or restricted to use in Formula 2.\n\nThe body shape of the Type 18 was dictated by the square chassis and was described by one journalist as \"an extremely ugly, tank-like body,\" with hopes that it would be only temporary. The increased drag coefficient of the flat sides was reasoned to be cancelled out by the reduction in frontal area. Brakes at both the front and rear were 9x1¾-inch outboard Lockheed systems fitted with finned aluminium Alfin drums to help give better cooling.\n\nFor Team Lotus, the 1960 season proved to be incredibly successful. Their three new drivers, Jim Clark, Trevor Taylor, and Peter Arundell, won almost every race they entered, and the new Lotus Type 18 won just about every major Formula Junior race in the UK that year.\n\nIn 1959, Lotus was still expanding and had taken on numerous other commitments.",
