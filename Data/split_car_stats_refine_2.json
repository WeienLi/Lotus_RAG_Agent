In 1959, Lotus was still expanding and had taken on numerous other commitments. The previous year's racing results had been poor, so Chapman decided that for 1960, a basic, simple, and easily maintained design was called for, rather than a technically superior but more complicated one. With simplicity in mind, the essentials were to minimize power losses, reduce frontal area, and keep the center of gravity as low as possible.\n\nThe Sixties saw Colin Chapman's persistent combination of dedication, design skill, and astute commercialism bring Lotus from the ranks of specialist constructor to a major British manufacturer.\n\n1960-69",

The intention was to use fuel from the front tank until an optimum handling set-up was achieved and then use fuel from the side tank for the rest of the race. At the 1960 Argentine Grand Prix, Innes Ireland led for a while but ultimately came in sixth, slowed down with gearbox problems. At Syracuse, where only F2 cars were allowed, Ireland raced a Type 18 with a 1.5-litre Climax engine and finished fourth. He followed this up with the team's maiden F2 victory at Oulton Park, and a spectacular Goodwood meeting at Easter, when he won both the F2 and F1 races – scoring the first-ever Lotus F1 win. Stirling Moss, in his Cooper, had been soundly beaten, and Rob Walker immediately ordered him a new Type 18.

Bristol saw production of the Elite as the ideal exploitation of their extensive expertise in glass reinforced plastic manufacture, in both aesthetics and construction. The Bristol plant built the chassis body units from a new set of molds supplied by Lotus, and technicians worked hard to make the finish of the molds as flawless as possible, in the hope that the resulting panels would be free of surface irregularities.\n\nThe first of these revised Series 2 Elite body shells were delivered to Cheshunt in July 1960, and Bristol would continue to supply chassis body units until the Series 2 ceased production in the autumn of 1963. With their much improved methods of working, these new shells showed a genuine improvement over the old Maximar units until complacency set in and workers at the Bristol plant began to 'cut corners', quite literally, and the quality of production dipped dramatically. Bristol was embarrassed and immediately rectified the problems that were occurring and took much greater care in the troublesome differential and radius mounting area.

Born out of the experience gained from the race track as well as the demands of the customer, the Series 2 Elite received subtle yet effective revisions to both front and rear suspension.\n\nAt the front, the dimensions of the springs were changed. Longer, softer springs, combined with new shock absorbers, gave a softer overall spring rate compared to the Series 1.

With the rear end now bolted firmly through the bottom of the hub carrier, this new system with revised geometry further isolated chassis loads and virtually eliminated the rear wheel tracking problems of the earlier cars. Another new model in the Elite range arrived at the 1960 Motor Show when a new Special Equipment model was introduced with uprated carburation and a tuned exhaust, producing 83bhp.

There were indeed several ways that this was achieved: chassis members were reduced in number; flooring to the engine bay and rear axle areas was omitted; steering geometry was simplified, including the use of a straight column; a very favourable deal for the supply of rear axles from the Standard 10 was struck with the manufacturers, which now meant the same natural stud centres to all wheels without the need for adapting hubs; cheaper 13-inch diameter Triumph Herald wheels were sourced from Standard Triumph; rear axle location was simplified by the use of an upper trailing arm to each end and a single lower 'A' bracket connected to the centre, under the differential, which also gave lateral support; the expensive aluminium nose and front and rear wings were replaced with coloured gel coat glassfibre parts, which removed the need for painting.

The suspension again followed the practice of the 18, with identical track and wheelbase sizes. However, the front and rear anti-roll bars were of a different size, as were the rear radius arms. The wider front end also meant that the top wishbone and suspension unit could not be mounted by a common bolt, so a short tube was placed between the top wishbone mountings.

In September 1962, the solution came in the form of the new Ford 5-bearing 116E Cortina engine. This was fitted in the Seven in two guises: a new model dubbed the 'Super Seven 1500', which had an unmodified engine with a single side-draught twin-choke Weber 40DCOE2 carburettor on a special Lotus cast alloy inlet manifold, and the replacement model now called the 'Super Seven 1500 Cosworth', whose engine, as before, had a worked head, special camshaft, and exhaust manifold, and a pair of side-draught twin-choke Weber carburettors.

The main British engine supplier to Formula 1, Coventry Climax, was unprepared for the move, and so the major teams (Lotus, Cooper, and even BRM) were forced to rely on the outdated four-cylinder FPF engine. Ferrari, by contrast, had been working on a new and far superior V6 power unit for some time.\n\nCoventry Climax hastily decided to develop a new V8 engine and issued installation drawings to the main teams. The eventual FWMV engine was, in fact, deeper and longer than planned, forcing chassis redesigns for those teams which had intentions to use the unit. For 1961, this particular problem did not affect Lotus. Colin Chapman's personal relationship with Coventry Climax's Leonard Lee was at an all-time low following rows over the quality of the FWE engines being supplied for the Elite road car.

The troublesome Lotus gearbox, with its one tiny set of dog rings to pick up every gear, was abandoned in favor of a ZF gearbox, which the German company made exclusively for Team Lotus, in four and five-speed forms.

The top wishbone was made of stainless steel and pivoted on a spindle which carried the entire front suspension load (a cross-brace was welded into the frame at an early stage to compensate). The inboard system alleviated a lot of drag and allowed for a lighter anti-roll bar. With much reduced power outputs in Formula 1, aerodynamics began to play a far greater role in ultimate success on the track, and the inboard system with its relatively clear airflow between wheels and body would be widely adopted by other constructors in coming years.

The impressive stiffness of this chassis gave him the idea that it could be used on a single-seater. His scheme was to space the sides of the backbone far enough apart for a driver to sit between them. It was all hatched at a lunchtime meeting with Mike Costin, when Chapman simply began sketching on a paper napkin. Straight after, he went home and drew up the general arrangement scheme of the first modern monocoque in Formula 1. He famously said afterwards: “Despite people telling me ever since that there were monocoque racing cars in 1911 or whenever, the Type 25 was the first as far as I was concerned – I had never seen one before, and we didn’t know if it would work.” The monocoque chassis was made from 16swg aluminum sheet, with the side members being long boxes containing the flexible fuel tanks and acting as the lower body half. All this was painstakingly riveted up in a jig, a rather laborious process. These boxes ended directly behind the cockpit, but two smaller boxes were riveted.",

The chassis finished at the rear with a square section hoop to which the rear suspension arms were bolted. Triangular channels in the frame’s underside carried oil, water, and hydraulic and electrical systems. With a monocoque tub, less space was wasted, and the Type 25 boasted the slimmest body ever seen in Grand Prix racing. No formal aerodynamic tests were carried out, but the simple principle of keeping the bodywork as tight as possible over the components minimized frontal area and reduced drag. The car was tailored to Jim Clark, who lay as near to horizontal as possible, and in fact couldn’t see the road directly in front of the car.

It is no overstatement to say that the Lotus Type 25 revolutionized Formula 1 design. It was a complete break from conventional thinking, advanced even for Colin Chapman, and its development was one of the best-kept secrets in motor racing. The major revolution was to abandon the traditional tubular spaceframe in favor of an aircraft-style monocoque, literally meaning 'single-shell'. The front suspension featured twin lower wishbones, tubular stub axles, and the steering box was mounted high on the chassis, level with the top suspension arm. The rear suspension had lower wishbones with a single inboard mounting point, a single upper arm, and twin radius rods, together with an anti-roll bar.

The body, designed by Ron Hickman, was moulded in two main glassfibre sections (floorpan/arches and upper body), which were then bonded together. Steel strengthening for the door jambs made it sufficiently rigid to not have to rely totally on the chassis for its strength. Clean aerodynamics favoured a pop-up headlamp arrangement, which was worked by two vacuum cylinders. The front and rear bumpers were made of plastic and filled with polyurethane foam. With very little frontal area to work with, Colin Chapman again used his ingenious method for the placement of a number plate at the front. The dark recess of the front air intake grill (painted black) was used as the dark background, while the white lettering was simply fixed to the wire mesh grille with clips. The Type 14 Elite had a number of distinctive features, including: Engine: 1.2 litres; Power: 130 bhp; Top Speed: 135 mph; 0-60 mph: 7.0 seconds; Weight: 725 kg. Whatever else can be said of the Type 14 Elite, it had been a salutary lesson in the art of automotive design.",

And there you have it, a perfectly legal airflow number plate! Whatever else can be said of the Type 14 Elite, it had been a salutary experience for Lotus. The monocoque bodyshell had been a brilliant idea, but was an ambitious move for such a small company. The Elite lost Lotus money and there had to be a better way. Colin Chapman saw it in the backbone chassis, which would become a Lotus hallmark for years to come. The backbone chassis concept made its roadcar debut in the Type 26 Elan, a model which was crucial to the future of Lotus. \n\nIn 1962, Chapman wanted a twin overhead camshaft engine for the Elan and turned to Harry Mundy of The Autocar magazine. Mundy, formerly with BRM and Coventry Climax, agreed to develop a double overhead-cam cylinder-head. Preliminary work was on the 3-bearing 109E block, until the Ford 116E 5-bearing block became available. The alloy heads were initially made by J.A. Prestwich, and then later on by Lotus itself. As announced, the Elan featured the following specifications: Engine: Twin overhead camshaft, Cylinder Head: Double overhead-cam, Block: Ford 116E 5-bearing.",

As announced, the Elan engine displaced 1498cc and was basically a detuned version of the same unit that had powered the Lotus 23, famously driven by Jim Clark to near success at the Nürburgring earlier in the season. The head, pushrods, timing cover, and water pump of the original OHV engine were discarded, and Lotus fitted the Mundy-designed aluminum DOHC head. However, the 100bhp engine was quickly superseded by the definitive 1558cc, 105bhp version, with twin-Weber carburettors. Almost all, probably 15 of the 22, examples of 1.5-litre Elans were subsequently recalled and converted to 1558cc spec.\n\nThe car stats are as follows:\n- Engine displacement: 1498cc (later 1558cc)\n- Power: 100bhp (later 105bhp)\n- Carburettors: Twin-Weber\n\nThe four-speed gearbox was derived directly from the Ford Classic, though the final drive ratio (in Lotus' own aluminum casing) was 3.90 instead of 4.125.

In place of aluminium bodywork, which was time-consuming and expensive to manufacture, it would have glassfibre sections. The monocoque chassis was made of 18swg aluminium sheet with a sheet steel front bulkhead encasing the front suspension, an aluminium sheet centre bulkhead (plus a humped seat pan which added some extra rigidity) and a third bulkhead (in sheet steel) at the rear which was completed by a tie-bar. This was all clothed in 1/4-inch thick glassfibre body panels which were firmly pop-riveted in place.\nThe Lotus 25 inspired front suspension utilised fabricated upper rocking arms, wide-based lower wishbones, modified Triumph Herald uprights and inboard coil-spring/damper units. The rear end was again familiar Lotus: reversed lower wishbones, single top links, twin radius rods, uprights made of magnesium and inclined coil-spring/damper units.

The Cortina GT had already proven itself in rallies and circuit racing, but it was becoming uncompetitive, and Ford needed an evolution model. It was to Colin Chapman that Walter Hayes of Ford turned to produce a world-beating saloon racer. Since Lotus was always in need of money, the project came as a welcome move. The initial plan called for Lotus to assemble 1000 cars so that it could be homologated for Group 2 racing.

Gurney had been impressed when he saw the Type 25 in Formula 1 and thought a lightweight, mid-engined car could do well against the heavy and predominantly front-engined Indy Roadsters. A lightweight, low-powered car which could run on regular pump fuel (most ran on methanol) was viewed with skepticism, but tests showed that the slower speed on normal fuel was outweighed by better economy, meaning fewer time-consuming pit stops. Ford went for Lotus, and the Type 29 was born. In general principle, the construction of the Type 29 monocoque followed that of the Formula 1 Type 25. It was wider, taller, and had a five-inch longer wheelbase, partly because of the regulations (which set a minimum wheelbase length of 96 inches) and partly because of the room needed to accommodate the Ford V8 engine. Lotus also cited the considerably taller stance of Gurney, compared to Clark, as another reason for the increased dimensions.

With a power-to-weight ratio of approximately 800 bhp per ton, Lotus felt justified in claiming that this was \"one of the most, if not the most, potent pieces of racing machinery ever built, surpassing even that of the pre-war Mercedes and Auto-Unions,\" and went on to say that the Type 29 could be expected \"to break almost every circuit lap record.\" A rear-mounted, four-speed Type 37A Colotti gearbox was used with two ratios blanked off.

In standard road-going form, the Elan was not the greatest tool on the track, and criticisms included bump steer, vague and unpredictable handling, as well as a propensity for broken wheels. Walker solved the bump steer problem by changing the height of the steering rack, and the handling was tightened up by replacing the rubber bushes with spherical bearings. As for the steel wheels, these were swapped for wider, center-lock, magnesium wheels. Another change was stiffer, shorter springs for a lower ride height, which in turn meant raising the height of the differential to compensate for the acute half-shaft angles. Walker's cars also gained small scoops on the lower body ahead of the rear wheels to help cool the brakes and differential, while vertical slits behind the arches allowed hot air to escape.

During 1965 and 1966, Ian Walker used one of his 26Rs, LRO 8C, in several road rallies both in the UK and Europe, scoring some good results including 1st overall in the 1966 Jacobean Rally. In early 1965, the Series 2 Elan roadcar was coming on line and thus prompted the development of a 26R 'Series 2'. First shown at the 1965 Racing Car Show, the S2 car featured a number of revisions designed to increase power and improve handling. As ever, factory records for 26R production are somewhat vague and feature missing, and or duplicated chassis numbers throughout the production of Series 1 and Series 2 cars, from 1964 to 1966. The commonly accepted number of 26Rs officially built is 97, but it is probable that more than 100 cars came off the line at Lotus Components in varying specification that often makes it hard to identify a true 26R amongst the many 26R replicas that were built in the day.",

        "content": "Perhaps Colin was driven by the fact that Ford, with whom he had developed a close association, had chosen Lola as its Le Mans partner and he wanted to upstage them. In any event, he had his way and went on to develop the Type 30. The backbone chassis of the Type 30 was inspired by the road-going Elan: a central box section with a rear Y-fork (which accommodated the mid-mounted engine and suspension assemblies) and a deep transverse box section at the front to carry the suspension. The central backbone was panelled in 20-gauge mild steel (found to be not stiff enough and uprated to 16-gauge after the first three chassis had been built); housed inside it was a 3-gallon rubber fuel tank (additional 9-gallon tanks could be installed in each of the body sills). Front suspension was by semi-trailing unequal length double wishbones and coil-spring/damper units, while at the rear the usual reversed lower wishbones and radius rods were supplemented by another novelty – upper wishbones. Rubber driveshaft couplings were once again specified. The four-spoke 13-inch alloy wheels were a development of the Indianapolis (Type 34) wheel, and enclosed Girling 11-inch solid discs at each corner.\n\nThe car stats are as follows: Model: Type 30, Name/Formula: Group 7 Sports Racer, Years of Production: 1964-65, Examples Built: 33 including series 2, Engine Type: Ford 289 Fairlane V8 pushrod, Engine Size/Power: 4727cc/350bhp, Length/Width/Height: 165in/68in/26.5in to top of screen, Wheelbase: 94.5in, Weight: 1529lb/964kg.",

The four-spoke 13-inch alloy wheels were a development of the Indianapolis (Type 34) wheel, and enclosed Girling 11-inch solid discs at each corner. The engine was Ford’s cast-iron 289 (4.7-litre) V8. As purchased from Ford in Hi-Performance tune, it developed 271bhp, but after Lotus had modified it and added four Weber carburettors, it produced around 350bhp. A ZF five-speed gearbox was fitted, and with the highest final drive ratio, a 200mph top speed was theoretically possible. Although the prototype displayed at the London Racing Car Show had an aluminium body, production cars got glassfibre bodywork. This was extensively wind tunnel tested because there was natural concern about front end lift at high speed. There were many development teething troubles, but the first car went to Ian Walker-Team Lotus in time for the 1964 Aintree ‘200’ – and Jim Clark came second. He would follow this up with the 30’s only major victory at Mallory Park, but the opposition was hardly first-rate and the Walker team effort petered out before the end of the season.",

He would follow this up with the 30's only major victory at Mallory Park, but the opposition was hardly first-rate and the Walker team effort petered out before the end of the season. At the 30's first transatlantic outing at the Canadian Grand Prix, Clark stalled on the grid and retired four laps later with overheating. A better result awaited in October when Clark came home third in California. The overheating problem was recurrent and was eventually cured by re-piping the cooling system. Poor braking also dogged the 30, and Series 1 cars never had particularly rigid structures. There was also concern that the Ford V8 was underpowered, although the lightness of the Lotus frame compensated. The 30 was offered to the public at a reasonable £3495, and the first private sale was to David Prophet, who raced extensively in South Africa. Some twenty-one examples of the Series 1 car were built. For 1965, a Series 2 version arrived. This had a simplified rear suspension mounting set-up, meaning that transmission work no longer required the removal of the suspension; other changes included a more robust structure.

Tecalemit-Jackson fuel injection was also adopted in place of Webers, which gave a reliable 360bhp, but an experiment with 5.3-litre Ford power at Oulton Park ground to a halt when it exploded during practice. Twelve Series 2 cars were built, and that season Clark won the Senior Service 200 road race at Silverstone and again at Goodwood on Easter Monday. Private cars run by JCB, John Dean, and Willment scored scant success. Overall, the Type 30 was a disappointing car and no match for the more accomplished McLarens and Lolas.\n\nGroup 7 'big banger' racing achieved some popularity in Britain in the mid-1960s.

Formula 3 represented a considerable step down in power terms, even from Formula Junior. While other constructors pursued more advanced methods of construction, Lotus, in effect, backpedaled. By now, tubular steel construction had been abandoned by Lotus in its single-seaters, but it was felt that the monocoque construction was not suitable, in terms of cost and repairability, for Formula 3. Its solution was to revise, in mild terms, the 1962 Lotus Type 22 Formula Junior car and introduce it as the Type 31 Formula 3 car.\n\nThe chassis was basically the same as that of the 22: round and square section tubing with a bulkhead which held the instruments and the steering column bracket, at the forward end of the cockpit. Suspension at the front was by unequal length double wishbones, an anti-roll bar, and outboard Armstrong coil-spring/damper units. At the rear was the classic Lotus system of single upper links, reversed lower wishbones, double parallel radius arms, an anti-roll bar, and coil-spring/damper units.
